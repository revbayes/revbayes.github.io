# Estimating a time-calibrated phylogeny from a posterior sample of unrooted phylogenies
{:.section}


In the previous [exercise 1]({{ base.url }}/tutorials/sequential_bayes/unrooted_gene_trees) we inferred the phylogeny of the North American firefly genus *Photinus*.
In this exercise, we will use the previous output to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny assuming a relaxed-clock model.


## Reading the data (posterior tree samples)
{:.subsection}
The first step is to read in the posterior tree samples from the previous analysis.
Here, we assume that we had 50,000 sampled trees (2x an MCMC of 25,000 iterations) in the previous step.
If we want to remove 20% as burnin, that leaves 40,000 samples.
Then, if we want 100 trees, we should take every 400th sample, thus specifying the option `thin=400`.
Obviously we would like to use as many trees as possible, but this comes at a computational cost {% cite Hoehna2024 %}.
```
treetrace = readTreeTrace("output/photinus_COI.trees", treetype="non-clock", thinning=400, burnin=0.2)
```
Let us double check how many trees we have for this analysis.
It should be 100 (or 101, if the tree for iteration 0 was included).
```
treetrace.size(true)
```


## Specifying helper variables
{:.subsection}
We get the taxon information from the first tree
```
taxa = treetrace.getTree(1).taxa()
n_species <- taxa.size()
```
And as usual, we create our vector of moves and monitors.
```
moves     = VectorMoves()
monitors  = VectorMonitors()
```


## Branch-Rate Model (relaxed clock)
{:.subsection}

Here, we assume a uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock.
Thus, we need to specify this lognormal distribution with a mean and standard deviation.
Specify a uniform prior on the clock mean
```
clock_rate_mean ~ dnUniform(0,1E4)
clock_rate_mean.setValue( 0.1 )
```
Also specify a uniform prior on the standard deviation of the clock rates
```
clock_rate_sd ~ dnUniform(0,1E4)
clock_rate_sd.setValue( 0.01 )
```
As the lognormal distribution is parameterized by the log-transformed mean, we need to transform the clock mean to log-space for the lognormal distribution.
```
clock_rate_ln_mean := ln(clock_rate_mean)
```
Now we can construct the lognormal branch length prior.
```
branch_rate_prior = dnLognormal(clock_rate_ln_mean, clock_rate_sd)
```
As can be seen here, it would be easy to replace this `dnLognormal` with a Gamma distribution (`dnGamma`) or Exponential distribution (`dnExponential`).


Next, specify scaling moves on the mean and standard deviation.
Since the mean is in real space, a scaling move should work.
Alternatively, we could us a sliding move.
```
moves.append( mvSlide( clock_rate_mean, weight=3 ) )
moves.append( mvScale( clock_rate_sd, weight=3 ) )
```


## Tree model
{:.subsection}

From our previous study {% cite Catalan2022 %} we know that the root age for Photinus should be around 42.5Ma.
We thus specify a normal distribution as the prior on the root age.
```
root_time ~ dnNormal( mean=42.5,sd=2.5, min=30, max=70)
root_time.setValue( 42.5 )
moves.append( mvScale(root_time, weight=2.0) )
moves.append( mvSlide(root_time, weight=2.0) )
```

The birth and death rates are drawn from a uniform prior.
```
birth_rate ~ dnUniform(0,1E6)
death_rate ~ dnUniform(0,1E6)
```
We initialize the birth and death rates with reasonable values.
```
birth_rate.setValue( ln(n_species/2.0) / root_time )
death_rate.setValue( birth_rate / 1E4 )
```
We apply moves to the birth and death rate variables using a scale proposal.
```
moves.append( mvScale(birth_rate,lambda=1.0,tune=true,weight=3.0) )
moves.append( mvScale(death_rate,lambda=1.0,tune=true,weight=3.0) )
```
Now we can specify the prior on the time tree as a birth-death process.
```
time_tree ~ dnBirthDeath(rootAge=root_time, lambda=birth_rate, mu=death_rate, taxa=taxa)
```
You could also apply more node calibrations, see [relaxed clock tutorial]({{ base.url }}/tutorials/clocks)

## Initializing the tree
{:.subsection}
In this analysis, it might be very important to initialize the time tree with a sampled topology.
Remember that the probability of the tree topology will be computed by the sample frequency {% cite Hoehna2024 %}, thus all topologies that were not sampled in the previous analysis have a probability of 0.
Such trees are problematic as we cannot initialize the MCMC with them, as computing the acceptance ratio entails a division by 0.

Henve, we initialize the time tree with the MAP tree from our previous analysis.
You could also use an externally rooted tree, which might be preferred.
```
unrooted_MAP_tree = readBranchLengthTrees("output/photinus_COI_MAP.tre")[1]
```
Now we need to make this tree bifurcating (the root was trifurcating) and to make it ultrametric.
```
unrooted_MAP_tree.makeBifurcating()
ultrametric_MAP_tree = unrooted_MAP_tree.makeUltrametric()
ultrametric_MAP_tree.rescale( root_time / ultrametric_MAP_tree.rootAge() )
```
Unfortunately, this transformation currently messes up the internal node indices in RevBayes.
Therefore, we use the trick to write the tree to a file and read it back in.
```
write(file="ultrametric.tre",time_tree)
time_tree.setValue( readTrees("ultrametric.tre")[1] )
```

In this specific analysis, we also want to infer the time-calibrated phylogeny.
Most important, this affects the root position.
Thus, apply a bunch of moves on the time tree.
```
moves.append( mvNodeTimeSlideUniform(time_tree,weight=n_species) )
moves.append( mvNarrow(time_tree,weight=n_species) )
moves.append( mvFNPR(time_tree,weight=n_species/5.0) )
```

## Connecting the time tree to the posterior sample of unrooted trees
{:.subsection}

First, specify a root branch fraction.
This has to be a uniform prior between 0 and 1, which is actually a Beta(1,1) prior.
```
root_branch_fraction ~ dnBeta(1,1)
moves.append( mvBetaProbability(root_branch_fraction, weight=2.0) )
```
The branch length trees are the trees we sampled in step 1.
We use our distribution `dnEmpiricalSample`.
```
phis ~ dnEmpiricalSample( dnBranchRateTree( time_tree, branch_rate_prior, root_branch_fraction ) )
phis.clamp(treetrace.getTrees())
```



## Running the Analysis
{:.subsubsection}
First, you must create a model object with all variables contained.
```
mymodel = model(time_tree)
```
Next, you must specify the monitors which write specific variables to a file.
```
monitors.append( mnScreen( clock_rate_mean, clock_rate_sd, printgen=10) )
monitors.append( mnFile(time_tree, filename="output/photinus_ultrametric_COI.trees", printgen=1) )
monitors.append( mnModel(filename="output/photinus_ultrametric_COI.log", printgen=1) )
```
Finally, set up an MCMC object with two replicates and run the MCMC simulation for 25,000 iterations.
Run this longer if necessary.
```
mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, moves, monitors, nruns=2, combine="mixed")
mymcmc.run(25000, tuningInterval=100)
```
At the end of the analysis, construct the tree summary as the maximum a posterior tree.
```
treetrace = readTreeTrace("output/photinus_ultrametric_COI.trees", treetype="clock")
map_tree = mapTree(treetrace,"output/photinus_ultrametric_COI_MAP.tre")
```

## Plotting the MAP tree in RevGadgets
{:.subsubsection}
Next, we plot the MAP tree and inspect it.
```R
library(ggtree)
library(RevGadgets)

LOCUS = "COI"

tree  <- readTrees(paths = paste0("output/photinus_ultrametric_",LOCUS,"_MAP.tre"))
plot <- plotTree(tree = tree ,
                 timeline = TRUE,
                 geo_units = "epochs",
                 node_labels = NULL,
                 node_labels_offset = 0.005,
                 node_age_bars = T,
                 line_width = 0.5,
                 tip_labels_size = 2.5,
                 age_bars_colored_by = "posterior")

ggsave(plot, file=paste0("ultrametric_",LOCUS,".pdf"))
```
