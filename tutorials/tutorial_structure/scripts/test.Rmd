# Installation

Revticulate can be installed in two ways.
The first is via CRAN, using the default `install.packages` function in R:


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Revticulate")
```

The second is via the remotes package, a lightweight package enabling installation from GitHub repositories.


```{r}
remotes::install_github("revbayes/Revticulate")
```

 The GitHub repository for Revticulate contains cutting-edge features and may contain bugfixes, but the CRAN is known to be stable for everyday use.

Upon first installation, Revticulate will run a package check.
This check searches for and .Renviron file that contains a RevBayes path. If the package doesnâ€™t find this file, or finds it without the path, the package prompts the user to use `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. This opens the .Renviron file, and the user will enter `rb={absolute path to revbayes}`. This can be edited at any time if there are multiple installs on the system, or if you recompile RevBayes and want to use a new version.

Before using Revticulate in knitr, make sure the following is in your setup chunk:

```{r}
library(Revticulate)
knitRev()
```

First, we will test that RevBayes is accessible to us. This is a Rev chunk, which we know because the header says 'rb'. This will fail if RevBayes cannot be found. If this is the case, check that the path in your Renviron goes to RevBayes, and restart.

```{rb}
variable <- "Hi there! Welcome to RevBayes! I am now going to read in some test data."
variable
```

Next, we will attempt to read in some data. Note that this file is stored in `tutorial_structure/scripts`, and so we'll going up one directory to the data directory.

```{rb}
molecular_data <- readDiscreteCharacterData("../data/example_file.nex")
molecular_data
```
