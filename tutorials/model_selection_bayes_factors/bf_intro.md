{% section Overview %}

This tutorial provides the third protocol from our recent publication
{% cite Hoehna2017a %}. The first protocol is described in the 
[Substitution model tutorial]({{ base.url }}/tutorials/ctmc/)
and the second protocol is described in the 
[Partitioned data analysis tutorial](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes_tutorial/raw/master/tutorial_TeX/RB_Partition_Tutorial/RB_Partition_Tutorial.pdf).

This tutorial demonstrates some general principles of Bayesian model
comparison, which is based on estimating the marginal likelihood of
competing models and then comparing their relative fit to the data using
Bayes factors. 


{% section Introduction %}

For most sequence alignments, several (possibly many) substitution
models of varying complexity are plausible *a priori*. We therefore need
a way to objectively identify the model that balances estimation bias
and inflated error variance associated with under- and
over-parameterized models, respectively. Increasingly, model selection
is based on *Bayes factors* [*e.g.*, 
{% cite Suchard2001 Lartillot2006 Xie2011 Baele2012 Baele2013 %}], which
involves first calculating the marginal likelihood of each candidate
model and then comparing the ratio of the marginal likelihoods for the
set of candidate models.

Given two models, $M_0$ and $M_1$, the Bayes-factor comparison assessing
the relative fit of each model to the data, $BF(M_0,M_1)$, is:

$$BF(M_0,M_1) = \frac{\mbox{posterior odds}}{\mbox{prior odds}}.$$ 

The posterior odds is the posterior probability of $M_0$ given the data,
$\mathbf X$, divided by the posterior probability of $M_1$ given the data:

$$\mbox{posterior odds} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0 \mid \mathbf X)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1 \mid \mathbf X)},$$

and the prior odds is the prior probability of $M_0$ divided by the
prior probability of $M_1$:

$$\mbox{prior odds} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1)}.$$ 

Thus, the Bayes factor measures the degree to which the data alter our belief
regarding the support for $M_0$ relative to $M_1$ {% cite Lavine1999 %}:

$$\begin{equation}
BF(M_0,M_1) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0 \mid \mathbf X)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1 \mid \mathbf X)} \div \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1)}. 
\tag{Bayes Factor}\label{eq:BF}
\end{equation}$$

Note that interpreting Bayes factors involves some subjectivity. That
is, it is up to *you* to decide the degree of your belief in $M_0$
relative to $M_1$. Despite the absence of an absolutely objective
model-selection threshold, we can refer to the scale [outlined by
{%cite Jeffreys1961 %}] that provides a "rule-of-thumb" for interpreting these
measures ({% ref tab_bf %}).

{% figure tab_bf %}
 |   **Strength of evidence**   |   BF($M_0$,$M_1$)**  | **log(BF($M_0$,$M_1$))** | **$log_{10}(BF(M_0$,$M_1))$**  |

Unfortunately, it is generally not possible to directly calculate the
posterior odds to prior odds ratios. However, we can further define the
posterior odds ratio as: 

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0 \mid \mathbf X)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1 \mid \mathbf X)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1)} \frac{\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_1)},
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_i)$ is the *marginal likelihood* of
the data (this may be familiar to you as the denominator of Bayes
Theorem, which is variously referred to as the *model evidence* or
*integrated likelihood*). Formally, the marginal likelihood is the
probability of the observed data ($\mathbf X$) under a given model
($M_i$) that is averaged over all possible values of the parameters of
the model ($\theta_i$) with respect to the prior density on $\theta_i$

$$\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_i) = \int \mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid \theta_i) \mathbb{P}(\theta_i)dt.
\tag{Marginal Likelihood}\label{eq:marginal_likelihood}
\end{equation}$$

This makes it clear that more complex (parameter-rich) models are
penalized by virtue of the associated prior: each additional parameter
entails integration of the likelihood over the corresponding prior
density. If you refer back to equation \eqref{eq:BF}, you can see that, with
very little algebra, the ratio of marginal likelihoods is equal to the
Bayes factor: 

$$\begin{equation}
BF(M_0,M_1) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_1)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0 \mid \mathbf X)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1 \mid \mathbf X)} \div \frac{\mathbb{P}(M_0)}{\mathbb{P}(M_1)}. 
\label{eq:bf_Formula}
\end{equation}$$

Therefore, we can perform a Bayes factor comparison of two models by
calculating the marginal likelihood for each one. Alas, exact solutions
for calculating marginal likelihoods are not known for phylogenetic
models (see equation \eqref{eq:marginal_likelihood}), thus we must resort to numerical
integration methods to estimate or approximate these values. In this
exercise, we will estimate the marginal likelihood for each partition
scheme using both the stepping-stone {% cite Xie2011 Fan2011 %} and path
sampling estimators {% cite Lartillot2006 Baele2012 %}.




{% section Estimating the Marginal Likelihood %}

We will estimate the marginal likelihood of a given model using a
'stepping-stone' (or 'path-sampling') algorithm. These algorithms are
similar to the familiar MCMC algorithms, which are intended to sample
from (and estimate) the joint posterior probability of the model
parameters. Stepping-stone algorithms are like a series of MCMC
simulations that iteratively sample from a specified number of
distributions that are discrete steps between the posterior and the
prior probability distributions. The basic idea is to estimate the
probability of the data for all points between the posterior and the
prior—effectively summing the probability of the data over the prior
probability of the parameters to estimate the marginal likelihood.
Technically, the steps correspond to a series of `powerPosteriors()`,
where the likelihood is iteratively raised to a series of numbers
between 1 and 0 (Figure [fig:ss]). When the likelihood is raised to
the power of 1 (typically the first stepping stone), samples are drawn
from the (untransformed) posterior. By contrast, when the likelihood is
raised to the power of 0 (typically the last stepping stone), samples
are drawn from the prior. To perform a stepping-stone simulation, we
need to specify (1) the number of stepping stones (power posteriors)
that we will use to traverse the path between the posterior and the
prior (*e.g.*, we specify 50 or 100 stones),
(2) the spacing of the stones between the posterior and prior
(*e.g.*, we may specify that the stones are
distributed according to a beta distribution), (3) the number of samples
(and their thinning) to be drawn from each stepping stone, and (4) the
direction we will take (*i.e.*, from the
posterior to the prior or vice versa).

This method computes a vector of powers from a beta distribution, then
executes an MCMC run for each power step while raising the likelihood to
that power. In this implementation, the vector of powers starts with 1,
sampling the likelihood close to the posterior and incrementally
sampling closer and closer to the prior as the power decreases.

The following procedure for estimating marginal likelihoods is valid for
any model in RevBayes. First, we create the variable containing the power-posterior
analysis. This requires that we provide a model and vector of moves, as
well as an output file name. The `cats` argument sets the number of
stepping stones.
```
pow_p = powerPosterior(mymodel, moves, monitors, "output/model1.out", cats=50) 
```
We can start the power-posterior analysis by first burning in the chain
and and discarding the first 10000 states. This will help ensure that
analysis starts from a region of high posterior probability, rather than
from some random point.
```
pow_p.burnin(generations=10000,tuningInterval=1000)
```
Now execute the run with the `.run()` function:
```
pow_p.run(generations=1000)  
```
Once the power posteriors have been saved to file, create a stepping
stone sampler. This function can read any file of power posteriors and
compute the marginal likelihood using stepping-stone sampling.
```
ss = steppingStoneSampler(file="output/model1.out", powerColumnName="power", likelihoodColumnName="likelihood")
```
These commands will execute a stepping-stone simulation with 50 stepping
stones, sampling 1000 states from each step. Compute the marginal
likelihood under stepping-stone sampling using the member function
`marginal()` of the `ss` variable.
```
ss.marginal() 
```
Path sampling is an alternative to stepping-stone sampling and also
takes the same power posteriors as input.
```
ps = pathSampler(file="output/model1.out", powerColumnName="power", likelihoodColumnName="likelihood")
```
Compute the marginal likelihood under stepping-stone sampling using the
member function `marginal()` of the `ps` variable and record the value
in Table [tab:ml_cytb].
```
ps.marginal() 
```

We have kept this description of how to use stepping-stone-sampling and
path-sampling very generic and did not provide the information about the
model here. Our main motivation is to show that the marginal likelihood
estimation algorithms are independent of the model. Thus, you can apply
these algorithms to any model, *e.g.*, relaxed
clock models and birth-death models, as well. 
For a more concrete example including data and Rev script, please see the follow-up tutorial {% page_ref model_selection_bayes_factors/bf_subst_model %}.




{% section Computing Bayes Factors and Model Selection %}

Now that we have estimates of the marginal likelihood for each of our
the candidate substitution models, we can evaluate their relative fit to
the datasets using Bayes factors. Phylogenetic programs log-transform
the likelihood values to avoid
[underflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow):
multiplying likelihoods (numbers $< 1$) generates numbers that are too
small to be held in computer memory. Accordingly, we need to use a
different form of equation [bfFormula] to calculate the ln-Bayes
factor (we will denote this value $\mathcal{K}$): 

$$\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}=\ln[BF(M_0,M_1)] = \ln[\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_0)]-\ln[\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_1)],
\label{LNbfFormula}
\end{equation}$$

where $\ln[\mathbb{P}(\mathbf X \mid M_0)]$ is the *marginal lnL*
estimate for model $M_0$. The value resulting from equation
[LNbfFormula] can be converted to a raw Bayes factor by simply taking
the exponent of $\cal{K}$ 

$$
\begin{equation}
BF(M_0,M_1) = e^{\cal{K}}.
\label{LNbfFormula2}
\end{equation}$$ 

Alternatively, you can directly interpret the strength of evidence in favor of $M_0$ in log
space by comparing the values of $\cal{K}$ to the appropriate scale
(Table [bftable], second column). In this case, we evaluate $\cal{K}$
in favor of model $M_0$ against model $M_1$ so that:

> if $\mathcal{K} > 1$, model $M_0$ is preferred<br>
> if $\mathcal{K} < -1$, model $M_1$ is preferred.

Thus, values of $\mathcal{K}$ around 0 indicate that there is no
preference for either model.

Using the values you entered in Table [tab:ml_cytb] and equation
[LNbfFormula], calculate the ln-Bayes factors (using $\mathcal{K}$)
for each model comparison. Enter your answers in Table [bfTable2]
using the stepping-stone and the path-sampling estimates of the marginal
log-likelihoods.





{% section For your consideration... %}

In this tutorial you have learned how to use RevBayes to assess the
*relative* fit of a pool of candidate substitution models to a given
sequence alignment. Typically, once we have identified the "best"
substitution model for our alignment, we would then proceed to use this
model for inference. Technically, this is a decision to condition our
inferences on the selected model, which explicitly assumes that it
provides a reasonable description of the process that gave rise to our
data. However, there are several additional issues to consider before
proceeding along these lines, which we briefly mention below.


{% subsection Accommodating Model Uncertainty %}

In some or many situations the number of possible models to compare is
large, *e.g.*, choosing all possible
combinations of substitution models {% cite Huelsenbeck2004 %}. Furthermore,
imagine, for example, that there are several (possibly many) alternative
models that provide a similarly good fit to our given dataset. In such
scenarios, conditioning inference on *any* single model (even the
'best') ignores uncertainty in the chosen model, which can cause
estimates to be biased. This is the issue of *model uncertainty*. The
Bayesian framework provides a natural approach for accommodating model
uncertainty by means of *model averaging*; we simply adopt the
perspective that models (like standard parameters) are random variables,
and integrate the inference over the distribution of candidate models.
We will demonstrate how to accommodate model uncertainty using
RevBayes in a separate tutorial, for example, {% page_ref model_selection_bayes_factors/bf_subst_model_rj %}.


{% subsection Assessing Model Adequacy %}

In this tutorial, we used Bayes factors to assess the fit of various
substitution models to our sequence data, effectively establishing the
*relative* rank of the candidate models. Even if we have successfully
identified the very best model from the pool of candidates, however, the
preferred model may nevertheless be woefully inadequate in an *absolute*
sense. For this reason, it is important to consider *model adequacy*:
whether a given model provides a reasonable description of the process
that gave rise to our sequence data. We can assess the absolute fit of a
model to a given dataset using *posterior predictive simulation*. This
approach is based on the following premise: if the candidate model
provides a reasonable description of the process that gave rise to our
dataset, then we should be able to generate data under this model that
resemble our observed data. We will demonstrate how to assess model
adequacy using RevBayes in a separate tutorial,
{% page_ref model_testing_pps/pps_data %}.
