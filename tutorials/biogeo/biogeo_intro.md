{% section Introduction | introduction %}

Many fundamental evolutionary processes, such as adaptation, speciation,
and extinction, operate in a spatial context. When the historical aspect
of this spatial context cannot be observed directly, as is often the
case, biogeographic inference may be applied to estimate ancestral
species ranges. This works by leveraging phylogenetic, molecular, and
geographical information to model species distributions as the outcome
of biogeographic processes. How to best model these processes requires
special consideration, such as how ranges are inherited following
speciation events, how geological events might influence dispersal
rates, and what factors affect rates of dispersal and extirpation. A
major technical challenge of modeling range evolution is how to
translate these natural processes into stochastic processes that remain
tractable for inference. This tutorial provides a brief background in
some of these models, then describes how to perform Bayesian inference
of historical biogeography using a Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) model in RevBayes.

{% section Overview of the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis Model | bg_intro2 %}

The Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) process models range
evolution as a discrete-valued process {% cite Ree2005 Ree2008 %}. There are
three key components to understanding the DEC model: range characters,
anagenetic range evolution, and cladogenetic range evolution ({% ref dec_cartoon %}).

when inhabited by a given lineage and left blank when uninhabited. Time proceeds
from left to right. (a) Dispersal: a new area to be added to the species range.
(b) Extirpation (or local extinction): the species range loses a previously
inhabited area. (c) Narrow sympatry: When the ancestral range contains one area,
both daughter lineages inherit that area. (d) Subset sympatry: When the
ancestral range is widespread, one daughter inherits the ancestral range and the
other daughter inherits only one area. (e) Allopatry (or vicariance): When the
ancestral range is widespread, one daughter lineage inherits a subset of the
ancestral areas while the other daughter inherits all remaining ancestral areas.
(f) Widespread sympatry: When the ancestral range is widespread, both daughters
inherit the ancestral range. (g) Jump dispersal (or founder speciation): One
daughter inherits the ancestral range while the other daughter inherits a new
unoccupied area.
{% endfigcaption %}
{% endfigure %}

{% subsection Discrete Range Characters | disc_range_char %}

DEC interprets taxon ranges as presence-absence data, that is, where a
species is observed or not observed across multiple discrete areas. For
example, say there are three areas, A, B, and C. If a species is present
in areas A and C, then its range equals AC, which can also be encoded
into the length-3 bit vector, 101. Bit vectors may also be transformed
into an integer-valued state, *e.g.*, the binary
number 101 equals the integer 5. Note, add 1 to the value of the
integer-valued state to access that state from a RevBayes object, such
as a rate matrix, *e.g.* the range AC with integer value 5 is accessed at
index 6.

{% table table1 %}
  |    Range    | Bits  | Size | Integer |
  |-------------|-------|------|-------|
  |$\emptyset$  |  000  |  0   |   0   |
  |A            |  100  |  1   |   1   |
  |B            |  010  |  1   |   2   |
  |C            |  001  |  1   |   3   |
  |AB           |  110  |  2   |   4   |
  |AC           |  101  |  2   |   5   |
  |BC           |  011  |  2   |   6   |
  |ABC          |  111  |  3   |   7   |

   {% tabcaption %}

  A, B, and C.
  {% endtabcaption %}
{% endtable %}

The decimal representation of range states is rarely used in discussion,
but it is useful to keep in mind when considering the total number of
possible ranges for a species and when processing output.

{% subsection Anagenetic Range Evolution | anagenetic %}

In the context of the DEC model, anagenesis refers to range evolution
that occurs between speciation events within lineages. There are two
types of anagenetic events, dispersal ({% ref dec_cartoon %}a) and
(local) extinction or exitrpation ({% ref dec_cartoon %}b).
Because DEC uses discrete-valued ranges, anagenesis is modeled using a
continuous-time Markov chain. This, in turn, allows us to compute
transition probability of a character changing from $i$ to $j$ in time
$t$ through matrix exponentiation
$$\mathbf{P}_{ij}(t) = \left[ \exp \left\lbrace \mathbf{Q}t \right\rbrace \right]_{ij},$$
where $\textbf{Q}$ is the instantaneous rate matrix defining the rates
of change between all pairs of characters, and $\textbf{P}$ is the
transition probability rate matrix. The indices $i$ and $j$ represent
different ranges, each of which is encoded as the set of areas occupied
by the species. The probability has integrated over all possible
scenarios of character transitions that could occur during $t$ so long
as the chain begins in range $i$ and ends in range $j$. We can then
encode ${\bf Q}$ to reflect the allowable classes of range evolution
events with biologically meaningful parameters. For three areas, the
rates in the anagenetic rate matrix are

$$\textbf{Q} =
	\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}
		& \emptyset & A & B & C & AB & AC & BC & ABC \\
		\hline
		\emptyset 	& - 	& 0 	& 0 	& 0 		& 0			& 0 		& 0 		& 0 \\
		A 			& e_A 	& - 	& 0 	& 0 		& d_{AB}	& d_{AC} 	& 0 		& 0 \\
		B 			& e_B 	& 0 	& - 	& 0 		& d_{BA}	& 0 		& d_{BC} 	& 0 \\
		C 			& e_C 	& 0 	& 0 	& - 		& 0 		& d_{CA} 	& d_{CB} 	& 0 \\
		AB 			& 0 	& e_B 	& e_A 	& 0 		& -			& 0 		& 0 		& d_{AC} + d_{BC} \\
		AC 			& 0 	& e_C 	& 0 	& e_A 		& 0			& - 		& 0 		& d_{AB} + d_{CB} \\
		BC 			& 0 	& 0 	& e_C 	& e_B 		& 0			& 0 		& - 		& d_{BA} + d_{CA} \\
		ABC 		& 0 	& 0 	& 0 	& 0 		& e_C 		& e_B 		& e_A 		& - \\								
	\end{array}$$

where $e = ( e_A, e_B, e_C )$ are the (local) extinction rates per area,
and $d = ( d_{AB}, d_{AC}, d_{BC}, d_{BA}, d_{CA}, d_{CB})$ are the
dispersal rates between areas. Notice that the sum of rates leaving the
null range ($\emptyset$) is zero, meaning any lineage that loses all
areas in its range remains that way permanently.

To build our intuition, let's construct a DEC rate matrix in RevBayes.

Assume you have three areas

    n_areas <- 3

First, create a matrix of dispersal rates between area pairs, with rates
$d_{AB} = d_{AC} = \ldots = d_{CB} = 1$.

    for (i in 1:n_areas) {
        for (j in 1:n_areas) {
            dr[i][j] <- 1.0
        }
    }

Next, let's create the extirpation rates with values $e_A=e_B=e_C=1$

    for (i in 1:n_areas) {
        for (j in 1:n_areas) {
            er[i][j] <- 0.0
        }
        er[i][i] <- 1.0
    }

When the extirpation rate matrix is a diagonal matrix (i.e. all
non-diagonal entries are zero), extirpation rates are mutually
independent as in {% cite Ree2005 %}. More complex models that penalize
widespread ranges that span disconnected areas are explored in later
sections.

To continue, create the DEC rate matrix from the dispersal rates
(dr) and extirpation rates (er).

    Q_DEC := fnDECRateMatrix(dispersalRates=dr, extirpationRates=er)
    Q_DEC

Notice how the structure of the rate matrix is reflected in the
transition probability matrix. For example, ranges that are separated by
multiple dispersal and extirpation events are the most improbable:
transitioning from going from A to BC takes a minimum of three events
and has probability 0.005.

Also note that the probability of entering or leaving the null range is
zero. By default, the RevBayes conditions the anagenetic range
evolution process on never entering the null range when computing the
transition probabilities (`nullRange="CondSurv"`). This
allows the model to both simulate and infer using the same transition
probabilities. {% citet Massana2015 %} first noted that the null rangeâ€”an
unobserved absorbing stateâ€”results in abnormal extirpation rate and
range size estimates. Their proposed solution to eliminate the null
range from the state space is enabled with the
`nullRange="Exclude"` setting. The
`nullRange="Include"` setting provides no special handling of
the null range, and produces the raw probabilities of {% citet Ree2005 %}.

{% subsection Cladogenetic Range Evolution | cladogenetic %}

The cladogenetic component of the DEC model describes evolutionary
change accompanying speciation events ({% ref dec_cartoon %}câ€“g).
In the context of range evolution, daughter species do not necessarily
inherit their ancestral range in an identical manner. For each internal
node in the reconstructed tree, one of several cladogenetic events can
occur, some of which are described below.

Beginning with the simplest case first, suppose the range of a species
is $A$ the moment before speciation occurs at an internal phylogenetic
node. Since the species range is size one, both daughter lineages
necessarily inherit the ancestral species range ($A$). In DEC parlance,
this is called a narrow sympatry event ({% ref dec_cartoon %}c).
Now, suppose the ancestral range is $ABC$. Under subset sympatry, one
lineage identically inherits the ancestral species range, $ABC$, while
the other lineage inherits only a single area, i.e. only $A$ or $B$ or
$C$ ({% ref dec_cartoon %}d). Under allopatric cladogenesis, the
ancestral range is split evenly among daughter lineages, e.g. one
lineage may inherit $AB$ and the other inherits $C$
({% ref dec_cartoon %}e). For widespread sympatric cladogenesis, both
lineages inherit the ancestral range, $ABC$ ({% ref dec_cartoon %}f).
 Finally, supposing the ancestral range is $A$,
jump dispersal cladogenesis results in one daughter lineage inheriting
the ancestral range $A$, and the other daughter lineage inheriting a
previously uninhabited area, $B$ or $C$ ({% ref dec_cartoon %}g).
See {% citet Matzke2012 %} for an excellent overview of the cladogenetic state
transitions described in the literature (specifically see this [figure](http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears#BioGeoBEARS_supermodel_graphic)).

Make the cladogenetic probability event matrix

    clado_event_types = [ "s", "a" ]
    clado_event_probs <- simplex( 1, 1 )
    P_DEC := fnDECCladoProbs(eventProbs=clado_event_probs,
                             eventTypes=clado_event_types,
                             numCharacters=n_areas)

`clado_event_types` defines what cladogenetic event types
are used. `"a"` and `"s"` indicate allopatry and
subset sympatry, as described in {% citet Ree2005 %}. Other cladogenetic events
include jump dispersal `["j"]` {% cite Matzke2014 %} and full sympatry
`["f"]` {% cite Landis2013a %}. The cladogenetic event probability
matrix will assume that `eventProbs` and `eventTypes` share the same order.

Print the cladogenetic transition probabilities

    P_DEC



```
       [
         ( 1 -> 1, 1 ) = 1.0000,
         ( 2 -> 2, 2 ) = 1.0000,
         ( 3 -> 3, 3 ) = 1.0000,
         ...
         ( 7 -> 7, 1 ) = 0.0833,
         ( 7 -> 7, 2 ) = 0.0833,
         ( 7 -> 7, 3 ) = 0.0833
       ]
```
{:.rev-output}


The cladogenetic probability matrix becomes very sparse for large
numbers of areas, so only non-zero values are shown. Each row reports a
triplet of statesâ€”the ancestral state and the two daughter statesâ€”with
the probability associated with that event. Since these are proper
probabilities, the sum of probabilities for a given ancestral state over
all possible cladogenetic outcomes equals one.

{% subsection Things to Consider %}

The probabilities of anagenetic change along lineages must account for
all combinations of starting states and ending states. For 3 areas,
there are 8 states, and thus $8 \times 8 = 64$ probability terms for
pairs of states. For cladogenetic change, we need transition
probabilities for all combinations of states before cladogenesis, after
cladogenesis for the left lineage, and after cladogenesis for the right
lineage. Like above, for three areas, there are 8 states, and
$8 \times 8 \times 8 = 512$ cladogenetic probability terms.

Of course, this model can be specified for more than three areas. Let's
consider what happens to the size of **Q** when the number of areas
$N$ becomes large. For three areas, **Q** is of size $8 \times 8$. For ten
areas, **Q** is of size $2^{10} \times 2^{10} = 1024 \times 1024$, which
approaches the largest size matrices that can be exponentiated in a
practical amount of time. For twenty areas, **Q** is size
$2^{20} \times 2^{20} \approx 10^6 \times 10^6$ and exponentiation is
not viable. Thus, selecting the discrete areas for a DEC analysis should
be done with regard to what one hopes to learn through the analysis
itself.
