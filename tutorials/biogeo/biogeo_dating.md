{% section Introduction | introduction %}

This tutorial describes how to apply a biogeographic dating analysis.
To do so, we will jointly estimate phylogeny and biogeography. One
benefit of this joint inference strategy is that the biogeographic analysis will intrinsically
accommodate phylogenetic uncertainty, both in terms of topology and
branch lengths. Another is that paleogeographic evidence has the
potential provide information about the geological timing of speciation
events in the phylogeny {% cite Ho2015 %}. Finally, biogeographic data may lend
support to certain phylogenetic relationships that have poor resolution
otherwise.

Modeling the interactions between phylogeny, biogeography, and paleogeography should also, somehow, inform our posterior estimates of divergence times throughout the clade.
After all, an island cannot be colonized before it comes into existence.
But encoding this intuition into our phylogenetic model requires some special considerations.

As mentioned in the [Simple DEC model tutorial]({{ base.url }}/tutorials/biogeo/biogeo_simple.html), Hawaiian silverswords are
nested within the subtribe *Madiinae*, alongside the
tarweeds, a clade of plants inhabiting in western North America. Fossil
pollen evidence indicates that *Madiinae* diversified
during a period of aridification from 15â€“5 Ma in the western regions of
North America {% citet Baldwin1991 %}. It's clear that silverswords colonized
Hawaii from western North America, but the timing of the event is
difficult to estimate. Even though the oldest Hawaiian island they
inhabit is Kauai, it is possible that silverswords first colonized older
islands in the Emperor Island chain that predate the formation of Kauai (>5 Ma).

This makes the application of standard node-based biogeographic
calibrations challenging, because it would require a strong assumption
about when and how many times the oldest silversword lineages colonized
Kauai. Did silverswords colonize Kauai once directly from the California
coast? Or did the colonize the younger islands multiple times from older
islands in the chain? And did the event occur immediately after Kauai
surfaced or much later? Because we cannot observe the timing and nature
of this dispersal event directly, we will integrate over all possible evolutionary
histories using process-based biogeographic dating method described in
{% citet Landis2017a %}.

{% endfigcaption %}
{% endfigure %}

The basic idea is that an empirically informed epoch model is capable of
creating conditions that favor key evolutionary transitions to occur
during one time interval over another. Unlike the time-homogeneous
probabilities that arise from, say, a molecular substitution process,
these age-dependent transition probabilities may identify rate from
time, and thus generate information about branch lengths in units of
absolute time ({% ref fig_biogeo_dating %}). A biogeographic
process that is constrained by paleogeographic connectivity is
well-suited to this purpose.

Note: like all dating methods, including node calibration methods, tip
dating methods, and fossilized birth death dating methods, process-based
biogeographic dating estimates are prior sensitive and dataset
dependent. Applying this model to alternative data sets should be done
with care!

Another note: This tutorial describes an analysis that is similar, but not identical, to the analysis conducted in {% citet Landis2018 %}.

Much of this tutorial will be similar to the previous sections, except
we are adding a birth-death process and a molecular substitution process
to the model graph.

{% subsection Analysis %}

To use date the silversword radiation using biogeography, it is
necessary that we transition from our simpler 4-area model to a richer
6-area model (see {% ref hawaii_areas %}). The mainland area (Z)
is necessary to force the silversword and tarweed clade to originate
apart from the islands. The area corresponding to the older island chain
(R) is necessary because we do not know *a priori* whether
silverswords colonized the modern islands directly from the mainland (Z
$\rightarrow$ K), or first colonized R and only later dispersed into the
younger islands any number of times (Z $\rightarrow$ R $\rightarrow$ K).
Thus, adding these two areas allows the silversword origin time to
precede the formation of Kauai when the dispersal rate is large.

Additionally, we will add three tarweed taxa to our dataset, increasing
the total number of taxa to 38. We'll use a molecular alignment for the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to estimate the phylogeny, which is a
657bp non-coding locus that is historically important for plant
systematics. Because the locus is relatively short, it will also leave
us with a fair amount of phylogenetic uncertainty in branch length and
topology estimates. However, because we're estimating phylogeny and
biogeography, it will be correctly incorporated into our ancestral range
estimates.

As usual, we'll begin by creating variables to manage our input and
output files

    range_fn = "data/n6/silversword.n6.range.nex"
    mol_fn = "data/n6/silversword.mol.nex"
    tree_fn = "data/n6/silversword.tre"
    out_fn = "output/epoch_phy"
    geo_fn = "data/n6/hawaii.n6"
    times_fn = geo_fn + ".times.txt"
    dist_fn = geo_fn + ".distances.txt"

Add the analysis helper variables

    n_gen = 25000    # more parameters, longer run!

Read in the molecular alignment

    dat_mol = readDiscreteCharacterData(mol_fn)

Read in the species ranges for six areas

    dat_range_01 = readDiscreteCharacterData(range_fn)

Compute the number of ranges when ranges may only be one or two areas in
size

    n_areas <- dat_range_01.nchar()
    max_areas <- 2
    n_states <- 0
    for (k in 0:max_areas) n_states += choose(n_areas, k)

Then format the dataset for the reduced state space

    dat_range_n = formatDiscreteCharacterData(dat_range_01, "DEC", n_states)

Record the complete list of range descriptions to file

    state_desc = dat_range_n.getStateDescriptions()
    state_desc_str = "state,range\n"
    for (i in 1:state_desc.size())
    {
        state_desc_str += (i-1) + "," + state_desc[i] + "\n"
    }
    write(state_desc_str, file=out_fn+".state_labels.txt")

Read the minimum and maximum ages of the island complexes

    time_bounds <- readDataDelimitedFile(file=times_fn, delimiter=" ")
    n_epochs <- time_bounds.size()

Read in the connectivity matrices between the six areas

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      epoch_fn[i] = geo_fn + ".connectivity." + i + ".txt"
      connectivity[i] <- readDataDelimitedFile(file=epoch_fn[i], delimiter=" ")
    }

Read the geographical distances between areas

    distances <- readDataDelimitedFile(file=dist_fn, delimiter=" ")

Remember that we are estimating the phylogeny as part of this analysis.
In general, it is possible that certain combinations of phylogeny,
biogeography, and paleogeography have zero-valued likelihoods should the
epoch model introduce reducible rate matrix structures [see the
supplemental of {% citet Buerki2011 %}]. The initial MCMC state, however, must have
a non-zero probability for it to work properly. Although it may not be
needed, we will provide tree_init as a starting tree for
the tree variable that we will create to be safe.

    tree_init = readTrees(tree_fn)[1]

We will record some basic information about the taxon set, the number of
taxa, and the number of branches in the tree

    taxa = tree_init.taxa()
    n_taxa = taxa.size()
    n_branches = 2 * n_taxa - 2

{% subsection The Tree Model %}

Because we will estimate the topology and branch lengths parameters, the
tree variable must be declared as a stochastic node with a
prior distribution. For this, we'll use a constant rate birth-death
process.

Assign root age with a maximum age of 15 Ma to reflect the ecological root age calibration for Californian tarweeds {% cite Baldwin1998 %}. No assumption is made
about the minimum root age.

    root_age ~ dnUniform(0, 15)

Add a move to update the root age

    moves = VectorMoves()
    moves.append( mvScale(root_age, weight=5) )

Assign the proportion of sampled taxa (we have a non-uniform sampling
scheme, but this should suffice).

    rho <- 35/50

Assign the birth and death priors. It is important to note that the
birth and death priors induce a root age distribution through the
birth-death process.

    birth ~ dnExp(10)
    moves.append( mvScale(birth, weight=2) )
    death ~ dnExp(10)
    moves.append( mvScale(death, weight=2) )

Instantiate a tree variable generated by a birth-death process

    tree ~ dnBDP(lambda=birth, mu=death, rho=rho, rootAge=root_age, taxa=taxa)

Add topology and branch length moves

    moves.append( mvNNI(tree, weight=n_branches/2) )
    moves.append( mvFNPR(tree, weight=n_branches/8) )
    moves.append( mvNodeTimeSlideUniform(tree, weight=n_branches/2) )
    moves.append( mvSubtreeScale(tree, weight=n_branches/8) )
    moves.append( mvTreeScale(tree, root_age, weight=n_branches/8) )

Provide a starting tree to ensure the biogeographic model has non-zero
likelihood

    tree.setValue(tree_init)
    root_age.setValue(tree_init.rootAge())

{% subsection The molecular model %}

To inform our branch lengths (in relative time units) and our topology,
we will specify a simple HKY+$\Gamma4$+UCLN model of molecular
substitution {% cite Hasegawa1985 Yang1998 Drummond2006 %}.

First specify a base rate for the molecular clock. This prior is uniform
over orders of magnitude, between $10^{-6}$ and $10^3$, and was chosen
to minimize its influence on the tree height.

    rate_mol ~ dnLoguniform(1E-6, 1E0)
    rate_mol.setValue(1E-2)
    moves.append( mvScale(rate_mol, lambda=0.2, weight=4) )
    moves.append( mvScale(rate_mol, lambda=1.0, weight=2) )

Assign log-normal relaxed clock rate multipliers to each branch in the
tree. These priors have a mean of 1 so each branch prefers a strict
clock model in the absence of data.

    branch_sd <- 1.0
    branch_mean <- 0.0 - 0.5 * branch_sd^2
    for (i in 1:n_branches) {
        branch_rate_multiplier[i] ~ dnLognormal(mean=branch_mean, sd=branch_sd)
        branch_rates[i] := rate_mol * branch_rate_multiplier[i]
        moves.append( mvScale(branch_rate_multiplier[i]) )
    }
    moves.append( mvVectorScale(branch_rate_multiplier, weight=3) )

Now we'll create an HKY rate matrix. First, we create a
gamma-distributed transition-transversion (Ts/Tv) rate ratio with prior
with mean equal to one

    kappa ~ dnGamma(2,2)
    moves.append( mvScale(kappa) )

then create a flat Dirichlet prior on the base frequencies over A, C, G,
and T

    bf ~ dnDirichlet([1,1,1,1])
    moves.append( mvSimplexElementScale(bf, alpha=10, weight=2) )

and, finally, combine the base frequencies and Ts/Tv rate ratio to build
the rate matrix

    Q_mol := fnHKY(kappa, bf)

Next, we'll create a $+\Gamma4$ across-site rate variation model. First,
we need a parameter to control the amount of site rate variation

    alpha ~ dnUniform(0,50)
    moves.append( mvScale(alpha) )

and a discretized Gamma distribution with four categories

    site_rates := fnDiscretizeGamma(alpha, alpha, 4)

The distribution of site rates categories has mean equal to one and
variance equal to $1/\alpha$. When alpha grows small, the
amount of site rate heterogeneity increases. When alpha is
large, the variance shrinks to zero, and the site rate multipliers of
`site_rates` converge to the value 1.

Finally, we'll create our molecular model of substitution

    m_mol ~ dnPhyloCTMC(Q=Q_mol,
                        tree=tree,
                        branchRates=branch_rates,
                        siteRates=site_rates,
                        type="DNA",
                        nSites=dat_mol.nchar())

and attach the ITS alignment

    m_mol.clamp(dat_mol)

{% subsection The biogeographic model %}

The biogeographic model is identical to that described in Section {% ref bg_epoch %}, so redundant details are omitted here.

First, create the biogeographic rate parameter.

    rate_bg ~ dnLoguniform(1E-4,1E2)
    rate_bg.setValue(1E-2)
    moves.append( mvScale(rate_bg, lambda=0.2, weight=4) )
    moves.append( mvScale(rate_bg, lambda=1.0, weight=2) )

The relative dispersal rate is fixed to 1

    dispersal_rate <- 1.0

the distance scale parameter

    distance_scale ~ dnUnif(0,20)
    distance_scale.setValue(0.001)
    moves.append( mvScale(distance_scale, weight=3) )

Next, create dispersal rates that are functions of distance between all
pairs of areas, but between areas that exist during epoch
i!

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      for (j in 1:n_areas) {
        for (k in 1:n_areas) {
         dr[i][j][k] <- 0.0
         if (connectivity[i][j][k] > 0) {
           dr[i][j][k] := dispersal_rate * exp(-distance_scale * distances[j][k])
         }
        }
      }
    }

Create the extirpation rates

    log_sd <- 0.5
    log_mean <- ln(1) - 0.5*log_sd^2
    extirpation_rate ~ dnLognormal(mean=log_mean, sd=log_sd)
    moves.append( mvScale(extirpation_rate, weight=2) )

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      for (j in 1:n_areas) {
        for (k in 1:n_areas) {
          er[i][j][k] <- 0.0
        }
        er[i][j][j] := extirpation_rate
      }
    }

Build a rate matrix for each time interval

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      Q_DEC[i] := fnDECRateMatrix(dispersalRates=dr[i],
                              extirpationRates=er[i],
                              maxRangeSize=max_areas)
    }

Treat epoch times as random variables, except the present is always the
present (or is it?).

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      time_max[i] <- time_bounds[i][1]
      time_min[i] <- time_bounds[i][2]
      if (i != n_epochs) {
        epoch_times[i] ~ dnUniform(time_min[i], time_max[i])
        epoch_width = time_bounds[i][1] - time_bounds[i][2]
        moves.append( mvSlide(epoch_times[i], delta=epoch_width/2) )
      } else {
        epoch_times[i] <- 0.0
      }
    }

Wrap the vector of rate matrices with the `fnEpoch` rate
generator function

    Q_DEC_epoch := fnEpoch(Q=Q_DEC, times=epoch_times, rates=rep(1, n_epochs))

Here, we treat the probability of different types of cladogenetic events
as a random variable to be estimate.

    clado_event_types <- [ "s", "a" ]
    p_sympatry ~ dnUniform(0,1)
    p_allopatry := abs(1.0 - p_sympatry)
    moves.append( mvSlide(p_sympatry, delta=0.1, weight=2) )
    clado_event_probs := simplex(p_sympatry, p_allopatry)
    P_DEC := fnDECCladoProbs(eventProbs=clado_event_probs,
                             eventTypes=clado_event_types,
                             numCharacters=n_areas,
                             maxRangeSize=max_areas)

Based on fossil pollen evidence, force range state and the root of the
tree to be the mainland area (Z)

    rf_DEC_tmp <- rep(0, n_states)
    rf_DEC_tmp[n_areas+1] <- 1  # Mainland (Z) is the only possible starting state
    rf_DEC <- simplex(rf_DEC_tmp)

Create the phylogenetic model of range evolution

    m_bg ~ dnPhyloCTMCClado(tree=tree,
                               Q=Q_DEC_epoch,
                               cladoProbs=P_DEC,
                               branchRates=rate_bg,
                               rootFrequencies=rf_DEC,
                               type="NaturalNumbers",
                               nSites=1)        

Attach the species range dataset to the model

    m_bg.clamp(dat_range_n)

To easily identify interactions between the posterior estimates of
island ages and divergence times, we'll create a deterministic node to
monitor the age of the silversword radiation. First, create a
deterministic node to monitor the crown age of the silversword radiation

    ingroup_clade <- clade("Wilkesia_hobdyi",
                           "Dubautia_reticulata",
                           "Dubautia_microcephala",
                           "Argyroxiphium_caliginis")

    ingroup_age := tmrca(tree, ingroup_clade)

Next, create a vector of variables to report the posterior probability
that the clade originates *before* a given island. When the
first argument in of the `ifelse` function returns
true, the node has value 1 and 0
otherwise. Thus, the mean of this variable gives the posterior
probability that the inequality is satisfied.

    for (i in 1:n_epochs) {
      ingroup_older_island[i] := ifelse(ingroup_age > epoch_times[i], 1, 0)
    }

Create the standard monitors. One difference is that the
`mnFile` monitor will now record the posterior distribution
for the tree variable, whereas the previous two tutorials
assumed tree was fixed.

    monitors = VectorMonitors()
    monitors.append( mnScreen(printgen=100, ingroup_age) )
    monitors.append( mnModel(file=out_fn+".model.log", printgen=100) )
    monitors.append( mnFile(tree, filename=out_fn+".tre", printgen=100) )
    monitors.append( mnJointConditionalAncestralState(tree=tree,
                                                      ctmc=m_bg,
                                                      type="NaturalNumbers",
                                                      withTips=true,
                                                      withStartStates=true,
                                                      filename=out_fn+".states.log",
                                                      printgen=100) )
    monitors.append( mnStochasticCharacterMap(ctmc=m_bg,
                                              filename=out_fn+".stoch.log",
                                              printgen=100) )

Because `ingroup_older_island` does not contribute to the
model likelihood, it must be manually introduced to the model object.
Compose the model object.

    mymodel = model(m_bg, ingroup_older_island)

Create the MCMC object and run the analysis.

    mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, moves, monitors)
    mymcmc.run(n_gen)

{% subsection Results %}


**Example results are located at and**

To understand the influence of the epoch model on ancestral range and
divergence time estimation, it is important to run addition analyses
with alternative settings. Scripts to jointly estimate molecular
evolution, historical biogeographic, and phylogenetic parameters are
available as `scripts/run_simple_phy.Rev` and
`scripts/run_epoch_phy.Rev`. The "epoch" analysis is
identical to the analysis just described. The "simple" analysis is
similar to the "epoch" analysis, except it substitutes the
paleogeography-aware model of range evolution (see Section {% ref bg_epoch %}) for a paleogeography-naive model (see Section
{% ref bg_simple %}).

{% endfigure %}

We see that simple analysis ({% ref simple_phy %}) estimates the
ancestral range at the root of the clade as Maui+Mainland (MZ) or Hawaii+Mainland (HZ). This is
unrealistic, both because of the extreme distance between those areas,
but also the simple analysis estimates the root age to be 10.3 (HPD95%
4.6, 15.0) Ma, well before Maui originated. (Date estimates are reported
in the `simple_phy.mcc.tre` and
`simple_phy.model.log` files.) The simple model also infers
Kauai+Maui (KM) as the ancestral range of living silverswords and a
ingroup crown age of 6.4 (HPD95% 2.2, 11.0) Ma, which is impossibly ancient
given the islands' ages.

The epoch analysis ({% ref epoch_phy %}) produces more sensible
ancestral range estimates, with Kauai being colonized first, and younger
islands only being colonized as they become available. The crown age of
silverswords is estimated as 3.3 (HPD95% 1.6, 5.0) Ma. When comparing
the results to the earlier fixed-phylogeny epoch results in {% ref epoch_RevGadgets_ase %}, we recover a greater role for
cladogenesis for the younger speciation events. These two analyses only
differ in terms of whether the phylogeny is fixed or estimated, so it is
likely a result of phylogenetic error in the fixed tree.

The colors black, blue, red, orange, and green correspond to the origination times of Kaui, Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and the silversword clade, respectively.The
left panel ignores paleogeography, allowing silverswords to originate
well before the formation of Kauai (`epoch_times[1]`).The
right panel conditions of paleogeography, which prefers a silversword
crown age that follows the formation of Kauai.

In Tracer, one can look at the sampled posterior of island ages in
comparison the origination time of crown silverswords ({% ref epoch_ages %}). The left panel shows the simple analysis, where
crown silverswords often originate before the formation of Kauai. The
right panel shows that crown silverswords probably originated before the
formation of Maui, but after the formation of Kauai.

  Posterior probability that the age of crown silverswords ($a_S$) is
  older than the origination times of K, O, M, and H
  ($a_K, a_O, a_M, a_H$, respectively). The "simple" model (Left)
  ignores paleogeography while the "epoch" model (Right) conditions on
  it.

By tabulating the results of the deterministic variable
`ingroup_older_island`, we measure the posterior
probability that crown silverswords originated before or after each
particular epoch in the model ({% ref tab_epoch_ages %}). Treating
$Prob>0.95$ as significant support for an evolutionary outcome, the epoch
model produces strong support that crown silverswords originated after
the formation of Kauai, $Prob(a_S > a_K) = 1.0 - 0.04 > 0.95$ but less support
that they originated after the formation of Oahu,
$Prob(a_S > a_O) = 1.0 - 0.59 < 0.95$.
