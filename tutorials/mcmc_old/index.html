<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to diagnose the performance of MCMC
simulations, such as the output from RevBayes. You will create a
phylogenetic model for the evolution of DNA sequences under a JC, HKY85,
GTR, GTR+Gamma and GTR+Gamma+I substitution model. For all these models
you will perform an MCMC run to estimate phylogeny and other model
parameters.</p>

<p>“<em>You can never be absolutely certain that the MCMC is reliable,
you can only identify when something has gone wrong.</em>” Andrew
Gelman</p>

<p>Model-based inference is, after all, based on the model. Careful
research means being vigilant both regarding the choice of model and
rigorously assessing our ability to estimate under the chosen model. The
first issue—model specification, which actually entails three closely
related issues—is critically important for the simple reason that
unbiased estimates can only be obtained under a model that provides a
reasonable description of the process that gave rise to our data.
<em>Model selection</em> entails assessing the <em>relative
fit</em> of our dataset to a pool of candidate models. Rankings are
based on model-selection methods that compare the relative fit of
candidate modes based either on their maximum-likelihood estimates
(which measures the fit of the data to the model at a single point in
parameter space), or on marginal likelihood of the candidate models
(which measures the average fit of the candidate models to the data).
<em>Model adequacy</em>—an equally important but relatively
neglected issue—assesses the absolute fit of the data to the model.
<em>Model uncertainty</em> is related to the common (and commonly
ignored) scenario when multiple candidate models provide a similar fit
to the data: in this scenario, conditioning on <em>any single</em>
model (even the best) will lead to biased estimates, and so model
averaging is required to accommodate uncertainty in the choice of model.</p>

<p>Much less concern is given to the second aspect of model-based
inference: the ability to obtain reliable estimates under the chosen
model(s). The implicit assumption, it seems, is that if a model is
implemented correctly, and if that implementation is successfully used
to obtain an estimate from a given dataset, then we must have performed
valid inference under the model. This would be perfectly sound reasoning
if inferences were based on analytical methods. Owing to the complexity
of the models, however, it is not possible to estimate phylogenetic
parameters analytically. Instead, parameter estimates are based on
numerical methods. In the case of maximum-likelihood estimation, these
are typically hill-climbing algorithms that attempt to search the
profile likelihood to identify the vector of point estimates of all
phylogenetic model parameters that jointly maximize the likelihood of
observing the data under the model. The reliability of these algorithms
can (and should) be assessed by comparing estimates obtained from
repeated analyses that are initiated from random points in parameter
space. Because there is only one <em>maximum</em> likelihood
estimate, the terminal values estimated by replicate runs should be
identical (within the precision of computer memory).</p>

<p>In the Bayesian statistical framework, inferences focus on the joint
posterior probability density of phylogenetic model parameters, which is
approximated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. It may be
comforting to know that, in theory, an <em>appropriately
constructed</em> and <em>adequately run</em> MCMC simulation is
guaranteed to provide an arbitrarily precise description of the joint
posterior probability density. In practice, however, even a given MCMC
algorithm that provides reliable estimates in <em>most</em> cases
will nevertheless fail in <em>some</em> cases and is not
guaranteed to work for any given dataset. This raises an obvious
question: “When do we know that an MCMC algorithm provides reliable
estimates for a given empirical analyses”. The answer is simple:
<em>Never</em>. Fortunately, this problem is not unique to the field of
phylogenetics. Much of Bayesian inference outside our field also relies
on MCMC algorithms to approximate the joint posterior probability
density of parameters: similar concerns regarding the reliability of
those inferences has motivated the development of a suite of diagnostic
tools to assess MCMC performance. The trick is learning how to use these
tools effectively and rigorously, especially for analyses that entail
complex phylogenetic models and/or large datasets.</p>

<h2 id="mcmc-basics">MCMC Basics</h2>

<p>The ability to rigorously diagnose MCMC performance requires familiarity
with some basic concepts from probability theory (discussed last time)
and a strong intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanics—we need
to know how the algorithms work in order to understand when they are not
working. In this installment we’ll briefly cover the mechanics of the
Metropolis Hastings MCMC algorithm.</p>

<p>Recall that Bayesian inference is focused on the posterior probability
density of parameters. The posterior probability of the parameters can,
in principle, be solved using Bayes’ theorem. However, (most)
phylogenetic problems cannot be solved analytically, owing mainly to the
denominator of Bayes’ theorem—the marginal likelihood requires solving
multiple integrals (for all of the continuous parameters, such as branch
lengths, substitution rates, stationary frequencies, etc.) for each
tree, and summing over all trees.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Bayesian inference of phylogeny typically resorts to
numerical methods that approximate the posterior probability density.
There are many flavors of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms—Gibbs samplers, Metropolis-coupled and reversible-jump MCMC,
etc.—we will consider the Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm because it
is commonly used for phylogenetic problems, and because it is similar to
many other variants (which we will cover elsewhere). Note that MCMC and
Bayesian inference are distinct animals: they have a relationship
similar to that between ‘optimization algorithms’ and
‘maximum-likelihood estimation.’ Some Bayesian inference can be
accomplished without MCMC algorithms, and MCMC algorithms can be used to
solve problems in non-Bayesian statistical frameworks.</p>

<p>To introduce the MH algorithm, we will imagine a robot that is programed
to explore an area. Specifically, the goal of our robot is to generate a
topographic map of an unknown terrain. This terrain has a total surface
area of one hectare. We deploy our robot by parachute at a random
location within the terrain. We have programmed the robot with three
simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If a proposed step will take the robot uphill, it
automatically takes the proposed step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a proposed step will take the robot downhill, it divides
the elevation of the proposed location by the elevation of the
current location: we call this quotient $R$. It then generates a
uniform random number, $U[0,1]$. If $U&lt;R$, the robot takes the
proposed step; otherwise, it stays put.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distribution for proposing steps is symmetrical. That is,
the probability of proposing a step (but not necessarily accepting a
proposed step) from point A to point B is equal to the probability
of proposing a step from point B to point A.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We allow our little robot to wander through the terrain following these
three simple rules. At prescribed intervals (<em>e.g.</em>, every
$10$ proposed steps), the robot records the details of his position (his
elevation, latitude, longitude, etc.) in a log. If we allow our robot to
wander long enough, his log is guaranteed to provide an arbitrarily
precise description of the topography of the terrain.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a slightly more formal description of the
Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. First some preliminaries. This
algorithm entails simulating a Markov chain that has a stationary
distribution that is the joint posterior probability density of
phylogenetic model parameters. The ‘state’ of the chain is a set of
parameter values that fully specify phylogenetic model:
<em>e.g.</em>, a tree topology, a vector of branch lengths, and a
set of parameters specifying the stochastic model of trait change
(<em>e.g.</em>, for the GTR + $\Gamma$ substitution model, this
comprises a vector of values for the four stationary frequencies, a
vector of values for the six exchangeability parameters, and the value
of the alpha parameter describing the shape of the gamma-distributed
among-site rate variation). Under the robot analogy, the state of the
chain corresponds to a unique point in the terrain. The Markov property
of the MCMC reflects the fact that the next state of the chain only
depends on the current state of the chain, but not on previous
states—that is, the past affects the future only through the present.
The Monte Carlo aspect of the MCMC reflects the fact that it is a
simulation: it is a numerical method that relies on repeated random
sampling.</p>

<p>Now, on to the MH algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Initialize the chain with values for all parameters, including
the tree topology, $\tau$, the vector of branch lengths $\nu$, and
substitution model parameters $\pi_i$, $q_i$, $\alpha$. We will call
the set of model parameters $\theta$. The initial parameter values
might be specified arbitrarily, or might be drawn from the
corresponding prior probability density for each parameter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select a single parameter (or set of parameters) to alter
according to its proposal probability. For the moment, we won’t
worry about the details of these proposal mechanisms—they basically
involve different ways of ‘poking’ the current parameter value,
$\theta$, to generate a new (proposed) parameter value,
$\theta ^{\prime}$. The important question at the moment is: Where
do these proposal probabilities come from? The answer is:
experience. We want to design the MCMC such that it invests effort
in a given parameter in proportion to the difficulty of
approximating that parameter. Note that the MCMC summarized above
will spend $\sim 2\%$ of its time proposing changes to the
exchangeability and stationary frequency parameters, but will invest
$\sim 40\%$ of its time proposing changes to the topology parameter.
Experience suggests that the tree topology is a more difficult
parameter for the MCMC to approximate relative to the
exchangeability and stationary frequency parameters (in fact, it
appears that the developers of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MrBayes</code> determined from their
experience that the topology is $\sim 20$ times harder
to approximate).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Propose a change to the selected parameter using the
parameter-specific proposal mechanism. Different parameters may
naturally have different prior probability densities—for example,
the stationary frequencies are proportions (ranging between $0$ and
$1$), and so are conveniently described using a Dirichlet prior
probability density, whereas the alpha-shape parameter can range
between zero and infinity, so is better described using a uniform
prior probability density. Different kinds of prior probability
densities will have specific proposal mechanisms—for example, there
is something called a ‘Dirichlet’ proposal mechanism that is used to
propose new values for parameters described by a Dirichlet prior,
and something called a ‘Slider’ proposal mechanism that is used to
propose new values for parameters described by a uniform prior.
(Again, we’ll go into the gory details of these proposal mechanisms
another time. The main idea for now is that the proposal mechanisms
generate a new parameter value by poking the current
parameter value.)</p>

    <p>The design of proposal mechanisms is something of a dark art—trial
and error are used to guide the development of mechanisms that work
well. Nevertheless, there are basic criteria that the proposal
mechanisms must meet. All proposal mechanisms must be:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>stochastic (new parameter values must be proposed
‘randomly’)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>irreducible (all parameter values must be potentially
accessible by the chain)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>aperiodic (the proposal mechanism must not induce
epicycles of the chain)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the probability of accepting the proposed change, $R$:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
R = \text{min}\Bigg[1, \underbrace{\frac{P(X \mid \theta ^{\prime})}{P(X \mid \theta )}}_{\text{likelihood ratio}} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{ P(\theta ^{\prime})}{P(\theta)}}_\text{prior ratio} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{P(\theta \mid \theta ^{\prime})}{P(\theta ^{\prime} \mid \theta)}}_\text{proposal ratio} \Bigg]\end{aligned}\]

    <p>The acceptance probability, $R$, is either equal to one or the
product of three ratios’ so long as that product is less than one
(because $R$ is a probability, so it cannot be greater than one).
So, what are these three ratios?</p>

    <p><strong>Likelihood ratio:</strong> the likelihood ratio is simply the likelihood
of the observations given the proposed value of the parameter,
divided by the likelihood of the observations given the current
value of the parameter. We can calculate the likelihood for any
given parameterization of the phylogenetic model using the
pruning (Felsenstein) algorithm.</p>

    <p><strong>Prior ratio:</strong> in Bayesian inference, each parameter is a random
variable, and so is described by a prior probability density.
Accordingly, we can ‘look up’ (calculate) the prior probability of
any specific parameter value. The prior ratio is simply the prior
probability of the proposed and current parameter values.</p>

    <p><strong>Proposal ratio:</strong> the proposal ratio is the probability of
proposing the current parameter value given the proposed parameter
value, divided by the converse. This is also called the Hastings
ratio. This is equivalent to the rule that forces our robot to
propose steps symmetrically; <em>i.e.</em>, that the
probability of proposing a step from point A to point B in the
terrain is equal to the probability of proposing a step from point B
to point A. For inference problems in which the dimensions of the
model are static, the proposal ratio is usually equal to one (we’ll
discuss exceptions to this in the context of reversible-jump MCMC in
a future post).</p>

    <p>Note that if the proposal ratio is equal to one, the acceptance
probability, $R$ is based only on the product of the likelihood and
prior ratios. Does that ring a bell? [Hint: think of Bayes’
theorem.] [Hint 2: think of the right side of Bayes’ theorem.]
[Hint 3: think of the numerator of the right side of Bayes’
theorem.] That is, the posterior probability is proportional to the
product of the likelihood and prior probability. Accordingly, the
acceptance probability is the posterior probability of the proposed
state divided by the posterior probability of the current state.
Just as we programmed our robot, if the ratio of the proposed and
current elevations (posterior probabilities) is greater than 1
(<em>i.e.</em>, it is an uphill step), we always accept the
proposed change. When the ratio of the proposed and current
elevations is less than 1 (<em>i.e.</em>, it is an downhill
step), we may or may not take the proposed step (stay tuned).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generate a uniform random number between zero and one,
$U[0,1]$. If $U&lt;R$, accept the proposed change; otherwise, the
current state of the chain becomes the next state of the chain.
Downhill moves will be accepted ‘randomly’ in proportion to the
difference in elevation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps $2-5$ an ‘adequate’ number of times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> Notice that the decision to accept or reject proposed
steps in the MCMC (and thus to sample from the joint posterior
probability density) is based exclusively on the likelihood and prior
probability of the proposed and current states—two quantities that are
easy to calculate. The beautiful, fantabulous achievement of the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is the slaying of the beastly denominator
of Bayes’ theorem. Specifically, the algorithm allows us to do inference
while entirely avoiding the need to calculate the (completely
intractable) marginal likelihood!</p>

<p>Approximating the joint posterior probability density is based on
samples from the MCMC: a chain following the simple rules outlined above
will sample parameter values in proportion to their posterior
probability. That is, the proportion of time that the chain spends in
any particular state is a valid approximation of the posterior
probability of that state (<em>e.g.</em>, if a clade is present in
$87\%$ of the samples drawn from the chain, then the posterior
probability of that clade is estimated to be $0.87$).</p>

<p>Why do we accept proposals to states with lower posterior probability?
People familiar with maximum-likelihood estimation often misunderstand
the purpose of accepting proposals to states with a lower posterior
probability. In maximum-likelihood inference, the game is to simply
climb relentlessly and mindlessly up the likelihood surface in search of
the very tip of the globally highest peak. Accordingly, the only reason
these zombie hill climbers might consider a downward move would be
motivated by concerns that they were currently climbing up a local
(rather than global) optimum. By contrast, Bayesians are not just
interested in the elevation of the very tip of the absolute peak of the
posterior probability surface, but rather are interested in exploring
and estimating the entire joint posterior probability density—we want
topographical map of the entire posterior probability, not the elevation
of the tip of the very highest peak in parameter space.</p>

<p>This survey of the joint posterior probability density results in a more
robust inference procedure (inferences are averaged over the joint
posterior probability of all model parameters), and allows us to
estimate and evaluate the marginal posterior probability density for
each of the parameters (these can be viewed by querying the MCMC samples
with respect to the parameter of interest—we will do this in future
tutorials). Accordingly, it is not sufficient for the chain to reach the
peak of the joint posterior probability density; we need the chain to
mix over the entire stationary distribution, spending time at each
location in proportion to its posterior probability.</p>

<p>Next to the specification of priors (which are inspired by much more
philosophical considerations), performance of the MCMC algorithm used to
approximate the joint posterior probability distribution is the greatest
concern associated with Bayesian inference (it is certainly a more
general concern, as it holds even when the priors are uncontroversial,
and, in my opinion, is a more legitimate and practical concern). There
are three closely related issues associated with MCMC performance: (1)
convergence (is the robot sampling from the stationary distribution);
(2) mixing (is the robot efficiently moving over the posterior
probability density); and (3) adequacy (has the robot collected
sufficient samples from the target distribution to describe it
adequately).</p>

<h3 id="data--model">Data &amp; Model</h3>

<p>We provide the data file(s) which we will use in this tutorial. You may
want to use your own data instead. In the ‘data’ folder, you will find
the following files</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘primates_and_galeopterus_cytb.nex’: Alignment of the <em>cytochrome
b</em> subunit from 23 primates representing 14 of the 16 families
(<em>Indriidae</em> and <em>Callitrichidae</em> are missing). Note that there is
one outgroup species included: <em>Galeopterus variegatus</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the same data and model as we used previously in the CTMC
tutorial.</p>

<p>Look at Model file &amp; MCMC file in a text editor.</p>

<h3 id="running-mcmc">Running MCMC</h3>

<p>Let us now explore the behavior of our Markov chain. The aim here in
these exercises is to visually inspect the output generated by
RevBayes. You should look at the trace plots using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code>. Watch out
for badly mixing chains, poor performance of the MCMC and correlated
parameter estimates.</p>

<p>The first analysis which we perform is specified as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>uniform GTR+I+G</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>single move per cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large proposal for all parameters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no-pre-burnin</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can run this analysis directly using</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source("scripts/mcmc_run1.Rev")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The operator summary provides you with an overview of the moves that you
have used for this MCMC run. It tells you what the weight for each move
was, the variables it has been working on, the number of times the move
was used, and how often the move was accepted. Good acceptance rates for
continuous parameters are between 20% and 60%. For discrete characters,
such as the phylogeny, there is no rule of thumb what good acceptance
is. Instead, the acceptance rate of tree topology proposal strongly
depends on the current data.</p>

<p>Now let us open the generated output file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code>. The file should
be called output/primates_cytb_test1.log.</p>

<p>What you may notice is that the ESS are very low and the MCMC is mixing
very poor. This is not good. We’ll try a new analysis but instead run
multiple moves per iteration. The new setting is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>uniform GTR+I+G</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>multiple moves per cycle</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large proposal for all parameters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flat &amp; low proposal weights</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no-pre-burnin</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We achieve this by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveschedule=“random”</code> (which is the
default) as an argument for the MCMC algorithm. You can run this
analysis in RevBayes using</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source("scripts/mcmc_run2.Rev")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Look at the output in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code> again. You should see that the ESS values
are still very low and the chain is still not mixing well.</p>

<p>One issue that you see is that shape and rate parameter ‘alpha’ for the
among-site-rate-variation is updated not often enough. It is quite
likely that our move proposed too many bad new parameters. So let us
change the window size for the scaling move applied on ‘alpha’ from</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>moves[++mvi] = mvScale(alpha, lambda=50.0, weight=2.0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>moves[++mvi] = mvScale(alpha, lambda=1.0, weight=2.0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us now the following set-up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>uniform GTR+I+G</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>multiple moves per cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>smaller proposals for ‘alpha’</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flat &amp; low proposal weights</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no-pre-burnin</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Run the analysis file and look how often the scaling Move is now
accepted.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source("scripts/mcmc_run3.Rev")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open the output and look at it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code>. We are now getting better
ESS values and better mixing of the MCMC.</p>

<p>That worked quite well but it seems to be cumbersome to adjust all the
tuning parameters of the moves manually. Instead, let us allow
RevBayes to auto-tune the moves. Just change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tune=true</code> for all moves
where it was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tune=false</code> before. Now, also include a pre-burnin. The
pre-burnin runs if you say
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mymcmc.burnin(generations=1000,tuningInterval=100)</code>. This runs a chain
for 1000 iterations and updates the tuning parameters, such as the
window size, so that you achieve a good acceptance rate. That means, if
previously a move accepted too few proposal it will decrease the window
size.</p>

<p>Here is the new model set-up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>uniform GTR+I+G</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>multiple moves per cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flat &amp; low proposal weights</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>pre-burnin (with scale adjusted from previous)</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Run the analysis in RevBayes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source("scripts/mcmc_run4.Rev")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Look at the output given by the operator summary. Notice how the tuning
parameters have been updated. Also look at the output in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code>. You
will see that the ESS values are much better because the chain is mixing
better.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-your-output-to-the-prior">Comparing your output to the prior</h2>

<p>Next, let’s compare it to the prior. Here we want to see how much
information we actually have from the data and how much our prior
influenced our posterior estimates. Run now an analysis that does not
use the data. You can do this in RevBayes by calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ignoreAllData()</code>
on the model object to mark clamped nodes as ignored.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source("scripts/mcmc_run_prior.Rev")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Load both the MCMC output under the prior and the posterior into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tracer</code>. Compare the approximated distributions on each parameter
between both outputs.</p>

<p>Apply multiple-run diagnostics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PSRF</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ASDSF</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comparetrees</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="semi-automatic-mcmc-diagnosis-using-bonsai">Semi-automatic MCMC diagnosis using bonsai</h1>

<p>Diagnosing MCMC performance manually can be extremely cumbersome,
especially for more complex models. The R package bonsai performs a
standard set of diagnostics on MCMC output and generates a report that
highlights potentially pathological MCMC behaviors. To use bonsai,
download the package source from
<a href="https://github.com/mikeryanmay/bonsai">https://github.com/mikeryanmay/bonsai</a>, launch the R console, and
install the package from source by following the instructions on the
bonsai main page (making sure to install the packages that bonsai relies
on as well):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>install.packages(packages=c('coda','tools','RColorBrewer','entropy','xtable'),dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages('&lt; path to bonsai &gt;',repos=NULL,type='source')
library(bonsai)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Move the output files from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run7</code> to the folder
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.../RB_MCMC_Tutorial/output/output_for_bonsai</code>.</p>

<p>Going back to the R console, provide a name for the project.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>project &lt;- 'Fagus run 7'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Point bonsai at the directory where we placed our log files.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>path &lt;- '.../RB_MCMC_Tutorial/output/output_for_bonsai'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we create the bonsai object and execute the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runBonsai()</code>
function. It will generate a report that draws your attention to
potential issues.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fagus_proj &lt;- bonsai(project=project,path=path)
fagus_proj$runBonsai()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check the flags generated by bonsai (Figure [fig:flags]; your results
may differ). Many of these flags may be innocuous; it is up to the user
to decide whether a particular flag is truly problematic. For example, a
correlation between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Likelihood</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Posterior</code> is not problematic;
however, a significant p-value for Geweke’s diagnostic for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pi[3]</code>
indicates that this parameter has not converged to its stationary
distribution.</p>

<p>There are additional bonsai reports for more complex models
demonstrating a wider array of MCMC pathologies in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.../RB_MCMC_Tutorial/bonsai_pre_cooked</code> directory.</p>
