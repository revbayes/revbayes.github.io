{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
- Modify the continuous-time Markove chain model by putting hyper-priors on the transformed parameters (note: $t_{1/2} = ln(2)/\alpha$, $V_y = \sigma^2 / 2\alpha$) and repeat the analysis.
- Are the priors put on $\alpha$ and $\sigma^2$ equivalent to the hyperpriors put on $t_{1/2}$ and $V_y$?
