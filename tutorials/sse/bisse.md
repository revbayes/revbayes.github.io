{% section Introduction | introduction %}

This tutorial describes how to specify character state-dependent branching process models in RevBayes {% cite Hoehna2016b %}.
For more details on the theory behind these models, please see the introductory page: {% page_ref sse/bisse-intro %}.

This tutorial will explain how to fit the BiSSE and MuSSE models to data using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
RevBayes is a powerful tool for SSE analyses:
to specify HiSSE model, please see {% page_ref sse/hisse %},
for the ClaSSE model, please see {% page_ref sse/classe %},
and for ChromoSSE please see {% page_ref chromo %}.


{% section Getting Set Up | thedata %}

We provide the data files which we will use in this tutorial:

-   [primates_tree.nex](data/primates_tree.nex):
    Dated primate phylogeny including 233 out of 367 species. This tree
    is from {% citet MagnusonFord2012 %}, who took it from {% citet Vos2006 %} and then
    randomly resolved the polytomies using the method of {% citet Kuhn2011 %}.
-   [primates_activity_period.nex](data/primates_activity_period.nex):
    A file with the coded character states for primate species activity time. This character has just two states: `0` = diurnal and `1` = nocturnal.
-   [primates_solitariness.nex](data/primates_solitariness.nex):
    A file with the coded character states for primate species social system type. This character has just two states: `0` = group living and `1` = solitary.
-   [primates_mating_system.nex](data/primates_mating_system.nex):
    A file with the coded character states for primate species mating-system type. This character has four states: `0` = monogamy, `1` = polygyny, `2` = polygynandry, and `3` = polyandry.

{% section Estimating State-Dependent Speciation and Extinction under the BiSSE Model | sec_CDBDP %}

Now let's start to analyze an example in RevBayes using the BiSSE
model. In RevBayes, it's called `CDBDP`, meaning *character dependent
birth-death process*.

> Navigate to the `RB_bisse_tutorial` directory and execute the `rb` binary.
> One option for doing this is to move the `rb` executable to the `RB_bisse_tutorial`
> directory.
>
> Alternatively, if you are on a Unix system, and have added RevBayes to your path,
> you simply have to type `rb` in your Terminal to run the program.
{:.instruction}

For this tutorial, we will specify a BiSSE model that allows for speciation and extinction
to be correlated with a particular life-history trait: the timing of activity during the day.
If you open the file [primates_activity_period.nex](data/primates_activity_period.nex)
in your text editor, you will see that several species like the mantled howler monkey
([*Alouatta palliata*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantled_howler)) have the state `0`,
indicating that they are _diurnal_. Whereas other _nocturnal_
species, like the aye-aye
([*Daubentonia madagascariensis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aye-aye)) are coded with `1`.
We may have an _a priori_ hypothesis that diurnal species have higher rates of speciation and
by estimating the rates of lineages associated with that trait will allow us to explore this
hypothesis.

Once you execute RevBayes, you will be in the console. The rest of this tutorial will proceed
using the interactive console.

{% subsection Read in the Data | subsec_readdata %}

For this tutorial, we are assuming that the tree is "observed" and considered _data_.
Thus, we will read in the dated phylogeny first.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"line", "28" }}

Next, we will read in the observed character states for primate activity period.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"line", "29" }}

It will be convenient to get the number of sampled
species `num_taxa` from the tree:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "3" }}

Additionally, we initialize a variable for our vector of moves and monitors.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "4" }}

Finally, create a helper variable that specifies the number of states
that the observed character has:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "1" }}

Using this variable allows us to easily change our script and use a different
character with a different number of states, essentially changing our
model from BiSSE {% cite Maddison2007 %} to one that allows for more than 2 states--*i.e.*,
the MuSSE model {% cite FitzJohn2012 %}.


{% subsection Specify the Model | subsec_specifymodel %}


The basic idea behind the model in this example is that speciation and
extinction rates are dependent on a binary character, and the character
transitions between its two possible states {% cite Maddison2007 %}.

#### **Priors on the Rates**

We start by specifying prior distributions on the diversification rates.
Here, we will assume an identical prior distribution on each of the
speciation and extinction rates. Furthermore, we will use a log-uniform
distribution as the prior distribution on each speciation and
extinction rate (i.e., a uniform distribution on the log of the rates).

Now we can specify our character-specific speciation and extinction rate
parameters. Because we will use the same prior for each rate, it's easy
to specify them all in a `for`-loop. We will use a log-uniform distribution as a prior
on the speciation and extinction rates. The loop also allows us to apply moves to each
of the rates we are estimating and create a vector of deterministic nodes
representing the rate of diversification ($\lambda - \mu$) associated with each
character state.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "6-10" }}

The stochastic nodes representing the vector of speciation rates and vector of
extinction rates have been instantiated. The software assumes that the rate in position `[1]` of each
vector corresponds to the rate associated with diurnal `0` lineages and the rate
at position `[2]` of each vector is the rate associated with nocturnal `1` lineages.

&#8680; If RevBayes has trouble finding good starting values, then you can initialize the speciation and extinction rate as follows:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "11" }}

You can print the current values of the speciation rate vector to your screen:
```
speciation
```
```
[ 0.267, 0.160 ]
```
{:.Rev-output}

Of course, your screen output will be different from the values shown above if your
stochastic nodes were initialized with different values drawn from the log-uniform prior.

Next we specify the transition rates between the states `0` and `1`:
$q_{01}$ and $q_{10}$. As a prior, we choose that each transition rate
is drawn from an exponential distribution with a mean of 10 character
state transitions over the entire tree. This is reasonable because we
use this kind of model for traits that transition not-infrequently, and
it leaves a fair bit of uncertainty.
Note that we will actually use a `for`-loop to instantiate the transition rates
so that our script will also work for non-binary characters.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "12" }}

Here, `rate[1]` is the rate of transition from state `0` (diurnal) to state `1` (nocturnal),
and `rate[2]` is the rate of going from nocturnal to diurnal.

Finally, we put the rates into a matrix, because this is what's needed
by the function for the state-dependent birth-death process.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "13" }}

Note that we do not "rescale" the rate matrix. Rate matrices for
molecular evolution are rescaled to have an average rate of 1.0, but for
this model we want estimates of the transition rates with the same time
scale as the diversification rates.

#### **Prior on the Root State**

Create a variable for the root state frequencies. We are using a flat [Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) as the prior on
each state. There has been some discussion about this in {% cite FitzJohn2009 %}.
You could also fix the prior probabilities for the root states to be equal
(generally not recommended), or use empirical state frequencies.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "14" }}

Note that we use the `rep()` function which generates a vector of length `NUM_STATES`
with each position in the vector set to `1`. Using this function and the `NUM_STATES`
variable allows us to easily use this Rev script as a template for a different analysis
using a character with more than two states.

We will use a special move for objects that are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "15" }}

#### **The Probability of Sampling an Extant Species**

All birth-death processes are conditioned on the probability a taxon is sampled in the present.
We can get an approximation for this parameter by calculating the _proportion_ of sampled
species in our analysis.

We know that we have sampled 233 out of 367 living described primate species. To
account for this we can set the sampling probability as a constant node
with a value of 233/367.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "17" }}

#### **Root Age**

The birth-death process also depends on time to the most-recent-common ancestor--*i.e.*,
the root. In this
exercise we use a fixed tree and thus we know the age of the tree.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "16" }}

#### **The Time Tree**

Now we have all of the parameters we need to specify the full character
state-dependent birth-death model. We initialize the stochastic node
representing the time tree and we create this node using the `dnCDBDP()` function.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "18" }}

Now, we will fix the BiSSE time-tree to the observed values from our data files. We use
the standard `.clamp()` method to give the observed tree and branch times:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "19" }}

And then we use the `.clampCharData()` method to set the observed states at the tips of the tree:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "20" }}

Finally, we create a workspace object of our whole model. The `model()`
function traverses all of the connections and finds all of the nodes we
specified.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "21" }}

You can use the `.graph()` method of the model object to visualize the graphical model you
have just constructed . This function writes the model DAG to a file
that can be viewed using the  program [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) ({% ref graphviz %}).

Then, the resulting file can be opened in the program [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/).

{% endfigure %}


{% subsection Running an MCMC analysis | subsec_runningmcmc %}


#### **Specifying Monitors**

For our MCMC analysis, we set up a vector of *monitors* to record the
states of our Markov chain. The first monitor will model all numerical
variables; we are particularly interested in the rates of speciation,
extinction, and transition.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "22" }}

Optionally, we can sample ancestral states during the MCMC analysis.
We need to add an additional monitor to record the state of each internal node in the tree.
The file produced by this monitor can be summarized so that we can visualize the estimates of ancestral states.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "23" }}

Similarly, you may want to add a stochastic character map.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "24" }}

Then, we add a screen monitor showing some updates during the MCMC
run.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "25" }}


#### **Initializing and Running the MCMC Simulation**

With a fully specified model, a set of monitors, and a set of moves, we
can now set up the MCMC algorithm that will sample parameter values in
proportion to their posterior probability. The `mcmc()` function will
create our MCMC object:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "26" }}

Now, run the MCMC:

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "27" }}

## **Summarize Sampled Ancestral States**

If we sampled ancestral states during the MCMC analysis, we can use the `RevGadgets` {% cite Tribble2022 %} R package
to plot the ancestral state reconstruction.
First, though, we must summarize the sampled values in RevBayes.

To do this, we first have to read in the ancestral state log file. This uses a specific function called `readAncestralStateTrace()`.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "28" }}

Now, we can write an annotated tree to a file. This function will write a tree with each
node labeled with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) state and the posterior probabilities for each
state.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "29" }}

Similarly, we compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) stochastic character map.

{{ bisse_script | snippet:"block#", "30" }}

{% subsection Visualize Estimated Ancestral States | subsec_ancviz %}

To visualize the posterior probabilities of ancestral states, we will use the `RevGadgets` {% cite Tribble2022 %} R package.


>Open R.
{:.instruction}


`RevGadgets` requires the `ggtree` package {% cite Yu2017ggtree %}.
First, install the `ggtree` and `RevGadgets` packages:

<pre>
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("GuangchuangYu/ggtree")
install_github("revbayes/RevGadgets")
</pre>

Run this code (or use the script `plot_anc_states_BiSSE.R`):

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(RevGadgets)

# read in and process the ancestral states
bisse_file <- paste0("output/primates_BiSSE_activity_period_anc_states_results.tree")
p_anc <- processAncStates(bisse_file)

# plot the ancestral states

{% subsection Summarizing Parameter Estimates | subsec_summary %}

Our MCMC analysis generated a tab-delimited file called `primates_BiSSE_activity_period.log` that contains
the samples of all the numerical parameters in our model.
Again, we will use the `RevGadgets` {% cite Tribble2022 %} R package, which allow you to generate plots and
visually explore the posterior distributions of sampled parameters.

{% section Evaluate Social System under the BiSSE Model | exercise2 %}

Now that you have completed the BiSSE analysis for the timing of activity for all primates,
perform the same analysis using a different character. Your `data` directory should
contain the file [`primates_solitariness.nex`](data/primates_solitariness.nex), which has the
coded states for each species habitat type. This is also a _binary_ character, where the states
are `0` = forest and `1` = savanna.

> Complete the BiSSE analysis for habitat type using the same commands given above.
> Remember it is useful to _clear_ the RevBayes console before starting another analysis. Do this
> using the `clear()` function.
>
> While you are setting up your new analysis, substitute the character data file name so that you read in
> `data/primates_solitariness.nex` instead of `primates_activity_period.nex`.
>
> It is **important** that you remember to also change the output file names.
>
> View the parameter log file in Tracer after your MCMC is complete.

{:.instruction}

{% aside Compare the rate estimates %}
Compare the rates estimated when the activity time is the focal character versus when solitariness is the dependent character.
You can do this by opening _both_ files in the same tracer window. If you managed to give all the parameters the same name,
it is possible to compare the estimates in the Tracer window by highlighting both files.

Explore the estimates of the various parameters. Are any different? Are any the same?

Why do you think you might be seeing this pattern?
{% endaside %}

{% section Evaluate Mating System under the MuSSE Model | exercise3 %}

In RevBayes it is trivial to change the BiSSE analysis you did in the exercises above to a multi-state model that is not limited to just
binary characters. That is because the model is effectively the same, just with the variable `NUM_STATES` changed.
For this final exercise, we will use the MuSSE model {% cite FitzJohn2012 %} to estimate the rates of speciation and extinction
associated with the mating system state for each primate lineage.

Your `data` directory should contain a file called [`primates_mating_system.nex`](/data/primates_mating_system.nex). This is a four-state
character where the states are: `0` = monogamy, `1` = polygyny, `2` = polygynandry, and `3` = polyandry.

> Modify the analysis you completed for the binary state characters in the [BiSSE Exercise](#sec_CDBDP) to accommodate a 4-state character.
> This means that you must not only change the input data file (`primates_mating_system.nex`),
> but you also need to specify `NUM_STATES = 4`. The `rate_matrix` must also be modified to accommodate 4 states.
