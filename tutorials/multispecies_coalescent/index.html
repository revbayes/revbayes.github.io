<h1 id="overview-gene-tree-species-tree-models">Overview: Gene tree-species tree models</h1>

<p>Ever since @Zuckerkandl1965a, researchers have acknowledged that
phylogenies reconstructed from homologous gene sequences could differ
from species phylogenies. As molecular sequences accumulated, the link
between gene trees and species trees started to be modeled. The first
models were based on parsimony, and aimed for instance at reconciling a
gene tree with a species tree by minimizing the number of events of gene
duplication and gene loss. In the past dozen years, probabilistic models
have been proposed to reconstruct gene trees and species trees in a
rigorous statistical framework. Models and algorithms have quickly grown
in complexity, to model biological processes with increasing realism, to
accommodate several processes at the same time, or to handle
genome-scale data sets. In this overview we will not detail these
models, and we invite the interested reader to take a look at recent
reviews (<em>e.g.,</em>(missing reference)).</p>

<h2 id="processes-of-discord">Processes of discord</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why a gene tree may differ from a species
tree. Of course, a gene tree may differ from the species tree just
because a mistake was made during the analysis of the gene sequences, at
any point in a pipeline going from the sequencing itself to the gene
tree reconstruction. Such a mistake would produce an incorrect gene
tree. Here we do not mean this kind of discord, but rather discord that
comes from a real biological process that generates true gene histories
that differ from true species histories. These processes include gene
duplication, gene loss, gene transfer (used loosely here to also include
reticulation, hybridization between species), and incomplete lineage
sorting (Fig. [fig1]). In this tutorial we focus on Incomplete lineage
sorting, which will be discussed in more details in the following
subsection.</p>

<p>Fig. [fig1] suggests that for all processes the gene tree can be seen
as the product of a branching process operating inside the species tree.
Indeed, all processes are modeled as some type of birth-death process
running along the species tree. For duplication/loss models, birth
correspond to gene duplication events, and death to gene loss events.
Transfers can be added to the model by introducing another type of
birth, with a child lineage appearing in another branch of the species
tree. Incomplete lineage sorting is also modeled with a birth-death type
of model, the coalescent. All these models can be made heterogeneous,
for instance by allowing different sets of parameters for different
branches of the species tree. This is useful to model differences in
rates of duplication, loss or transfer among species, or to model
different effective population sizes in a species tree. In
<code class="highlighter-rouge">RevBayes</code> so far only models of incomplete lineage sorting
have been implemented (models of duplication and loss and transfer will
soon be added). Thanks to <code class="highlighter-rouge">RevBayes</code> modular design, there
is quite a lot of flexibility in specifying the model, for instance by
associating different parameters to different branches of the species
tree, or by combining the gene tree-species tree model to other types of
models, for instance models of trait evolution, or models of relaxed
molecular clock.</p>

<h2 id="gene-tree-discordance-is-a-problem-for-species-tree-reconstruction">Gene tree discordance is a problem for species tree reconstruction</h2>

<p>There have been several approaches to species tree reconstruction:
concatenation and supertree approaches, which have been used for quite
some time now, and more recently methods that rely on gene tree-species
tree models.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Concatenation simply consists in taking all gene alignments,
concatenating them into one super alignment, and then analyzing it
as if it were a single gene sequence. More sophisticated approaches
allow different partitions for different genes, but the main
assumption at the heart of this approach is that all sites of all
genes have evolved according to the same species tree. This
assumption is often not correct because all the processes of discord
presented above conspire to make gene trees different from the
species tree. In practice, this matters: simulation studies have
found that in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, in some
particular areas of the parameter space, concatenation will often
return an incorrect species tree <a href="#Leache2011">(Leaché and Rannala 2011)</a>. Concatenation may
also be a questionable approach in prokaryotic phylogenetics, where
the quest for a tree of life has been difficult, to the point that
some doubted that one could find a meaningful species tree
representing vertical descent. Nonetheless, the concatenation
approach may be fairly robust to lateral gene transfers, as it
returns good species trees (arguably better than small subunit or
large subunit rRNA trees) in a range of prokaryotic groups
(missing reference).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supertree approaches differ from concatenation notably by discarding
sequence information once individual gene trees have been built.
Contrary to concatenation approaches that combine individual gene
alignments, supertree approaches combine individual gene trees to
obtain a species tree. Most supertree methods are not based on an
explicit model of the processes causing discordance between gene
trees and species tree (although there are exceptions, notably
modelling incomplete lineage sorting, see below). Instead, they aim
at finding a tree that would best describe the distribution of gene
trees, according to some fairly arbitrary criterion. In practice,
these methods have been found to provide reasonable results in many
cases, but in simulations they are usually less accurate
than concatenation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Methods that rely on gene tree-species tree models appear very
promising as they explicitly model the processes of discord. The
advantage of these models is that we account for processes that we
know have taken a part in generating the data, thus possibly
improving the accuracy and robustness of our inferences. Further,
these models can be combined with
<em>e.g.,</em>models of sequence evolution,
models of co-evolution between gene trees, or models of trait
evolution. However, these models are computationally challenging to
use, because they require estimating jointly gene trees, species
trees, and other parameters that entertain strong correlations. As a
consequence, in many gene tree-species tree models, devising a
well-mixing MCMC strategy can be problematic.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="modeling-incomplete-lineage-sorting-the-multispecies-coalescent">Modeling incomplete lineage sorting: the multispecies coalescent</h1>

<p>Incomplete lineage sorting is a population-level process. In a species,
at a given time, there are several alleles for a given locus in the
genome. These alleles have their own history, they diverged from each
other at various times in the past. This history can differ from the
species history, because several alleles can persist through a
speciation event, and because, even without selective effects, the
sorting of alleles during a speciation event is random and can result in
a tree that differs from the species tree (Fig. [fig1]d). In all
cases, incongruence between the gene tree and the species tree occurs
when alleles persist over the course of several speciation events. When
reconstructing a gene tree, one therefore gets the history of the
alleles that have been sampled (at best), not the history of the
species.</p>

<p>In 2003, Rannala and Yang proposed a powerful way to model the sorting
of alleles along a phylogeny of several species <a href="#Rannala2003">(Rannala and Yang 2003)</a>, the
multispecies coalescent (Fig. [fig2]). This model is at the origin of
most model-based approaches to reconstruct gene and species trees
(missing reference). The multispecies coalescent models the
evolution of a population of alleles along a species tree. Along the
species tree, it allows different branch lengths, in units of time, and
also allows different effective population sizes. Computing the
probability of a gene tree given a species tree and other parameters is
quite easy. Basically it works by cutting the gene tree into independent
species-specific subtrees, computing probabilities for each of those
subtrees, and combining them all at the end to get the probability of
the gene tree according to the multispecies coalescent, given the
current parameter values. Cutting the gene tree into species-specific
subtrees is quite easy, because we can use the dates of speciation
events to identify parts of the gene trees that are before and after
speciation events. The resulting subtrees are represented with the grey
boxes in Fig. [fig2]. In this figure, each subtree corresponds to one
particular population, either extant or ancestral. Inside each subtree,
given its length, the effective population size, and dates of
coalescence (divergences of alleles), the coalescent model provides
simple formulas for computing the probability of the gene subtree given
other parameters. Because we consider that these subtree probabilities
are all independent of one another, they are then multiplied to get the
gene tree probability given current parameter values.</p>

<p>Two parameters associated to branches of the species tree have a direct
impact on the expected amount of gene tree-species tree incongruence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time between speciations.</strong> The more a branch length increases,
the more the pool of alleles is expected to change. Alleles are
therefore less likely to persist for several speciation events if
the branches between these speciation events are long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Effective population size between speciations.</strong> In populations
with small effective population sizes, chance events can cause large
shifts in allele frequencies, and possibly disappearance of alleles.
In large populations, because an allele is likely carried by a large
number of individuals, its disappearance is less likely, the
population of alleles is more stable. Alleles are therefore less
likely to persist for several speciation events if the branches
between these speciation events are characterized by small effective
population sizes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, larger amounts of gene tree-species tree incongruence are
expected in phylogenies characterized by short branches with large
population sizes. A corollary of that is that larger amounts of gene
tree-gene tree incongruence are expected as well. To measure the
susceptibility of species phylogenies to generate incomplete lineage
sorting, the concept of <em>coalescent time units</em> has been introduced.
Coalescent time units are obtained when branch length $\lambda$, in
number of generations, is divided by effective population size $N_e$. As
a consequence, in a species tree whose branches are expressed in
coalescent time units, a branch length of $1~coalescent~time~unit $
means a branch length of $N_e~generations$. Once branch lengths on the
species tree are measured in coalescent time units, it becomes easy to
spot species trees that generate a lot of incongruence: those are short
trees.</p>

<p>The exercises assume you have a working installation of RevBayes. In
this introductory tutorial, we will apply the multispecies coalescent
model to 10 gene alignments from 23 primate species. We will specify the
multispecies coalescent, with different effective population sizes for
each branch of the species tree. We will assume that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The species tree is drawn from a constant birth-death process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along the branches of the species tree, a multispecies coalescent
process generates gene trees. Different effective population sizes
are assigned to each branch of the species tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along each gene tree, gene sequences are evolved according to an HKY
modeland a strict global clock. To save computing time, we do not
use gamma distributed rate variation among sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, we run an MCMC on this model, using data from 10 genes in 23
mammalian species.</p>

    <p>We specify a constant-rate birth-death process as our prior on the
species tree. The birth-death process has a speciation and
extinction rate as its parameters. We use here a transformation and
specify priors on the speciation rate and relative extinction rate.
Additionally, we calibrate the tree by assuming that the crown age
of primates is around 75 MYA. Thus, we specify a normal distribution
with mean 75 and standard deviation 2.5 as the prior on the root
age. Since the root age can only be a positive real number we
truncate the normal distribution at 0.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Mixing in the multispecies coalescent model is particularly
challenging. Although, in principle and assuming our MCMC is working
as intended, after an infinite amount of time we would converge to a
correct estimate of the posterior distribution over the species
tree, gene trees and other parameters, it is advisable to start from
reasonable starting values for the species tree and the gene trees.
In our case, we have already reconstructed candidate gene trees
using RevBayes. These gene trees have been produced using the
scripts:\
<em>$tutorials/RB_MultispeciesCoalescent_Tutorial/scripts/mcmc_GeneTree.Rev$</em>
and\
<em>$tutorials/RB_MultispeciesCoalescent_Tutorial/construct_all_GeneTrees.sh$</em>).
They have been placed in the folder
<em>$tutorials/RB_MultispeciesCoalescent_Tutorial/output_GeneTrees$</em>,
and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) trees have been constructed. These
MAP trees will provide good starting gene trees, and will also be
used to generate a starting species tree using a function that
computes a maximum tree <a href="#Edwards2007">(Edwards et al. 2007)</a>. The maximum tree “is the
tree with the largest possible speciation times in the space of
species trees restricted by available gene trees” <a href="#Liu2010">(Liu et al. 2010)</a>.
Conveniently, tip names in the gene trees correspond to the species
names: we can thus use the maximum tree function on these trees
without worrying about potential name inconsistencies.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Now that we have a species tree, we can specify the prior on the
gene trees by using a multispecies coalescent process. First, we
need to load in a map of the individual names to the species names.
This map ensures we can associate the individuals to the species
they belong to. Have a look in one of these files, for example
<em>primates_COIII_species_map.txt</em>. We will assume that each branch
of the species tree, which represents a population, has its own
population size. Thus, our prior is that each population size per
branch is identically distributed from an exponential distribution
with rate 0.1 (giving an expectation of 10 and thus a relatively
flat prior distribution). Note that we use fixed population sizes
for the terminal branches because we have only a single individual
per species and thus have no information about its population size.
One could use other models for the population sizes. For example one
could assume that all branches have the same population size. Once
the gene trees have been declared, we set their value to the MAP
trees that we have read previously.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># We assume independent effective population size parameters for each branch of the species tree.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have defined both the species tree and the gene trees,
we have not set up the moves that we use to sample them. We will use
simple tree moves, that deal with a single tree at a time, and joing
species tree-gene tree moves. Those latter moves are important
because they explicitly take into account the interdependency
between the species tree and the gene trees. These moves are first
declared with the species tree as main argument. Then, each gene
tree is added to the moves.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Now we have gene trees, complete with branch lengths, and the moves
operating on them. The next element we need is a clock rate which
transforms/scales the branch times into branch lengths that
represent the expected number of substitutions. Here we will assume
for simplicity that every gene evolves under a global strict clock
but has its own independent clock rate. We can later look into the
estimate to see how much the clock rate estimates actually differ
across genes. One could also choose to use a relaxed clock model
instead of a strict clock.</p>

    <p>Finally, we need to perform inference under the model, using the
data. For clarity, we put the results in an output folder, and the
gene trees will be further included within a folder of their own.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>output_folder = "output_MSC/"

# Monitors to check the progression of the program
monitors[1] = mnScreen(printgen=100, psi)
monitors[2] = mnModel(filename=output_folder+"posterior_MSC_primates.log",printgen=10, separator = TAB)
monitors[3] = mnFile(filename=output_folder+"posterior_MSC_primates.trees",printgen=10, separator = TAB, psi)
for ( i in 1:num_loci ) {
    # We add a monitor for each gene tree
    monitors[i+3] = mnFile(filename=output_folder+"geneTrees/posterior_" + locus_names[i] + ".trees",printgen=10, separator = TAB, geneTree[i])
}

# Here we use a plain MCMC. You could also set nruns=2 for an analysis with 2 replicates.
# or use mcmcmc with heated chains.
mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, monitors, moves, nruns=1)

# Ideally one would run more MCMC samples.
# In the interest of time it may be worth running the analysis under the prior.
mymcmc.burnin(generations=1000,tuningInterval=50)#, underPrior=true)
mymcmc.run(generations=3000)#, underPrior=true)


mymcmc.operatorSummary()
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we can perform some post-run analyses, for instance to obtain
and save the MAP species tree.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Now, we will analyze the tree output.
# Let us start by reading in the tree trace
treetrace = readTreeTrace(output_folder+"posterior_MSC_primates.trees", treetype="clock")
# and get the summary of the tree trace
treetrace.summarize()

mapTree(treetrace,output_folder+"posterior_MSC_primates_MAP.tree")

<h1 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about</h1>

<p>Do you find that the full multispecies coalescent mixes well?\
Is the mixing markedly different when the model is run under the prior?\
What is the impact of species tree moves on the mixing?\
Given the acceptance ratios of some of the moves, would you be tempted
to change the frequency at which they are tried? If so how?\
What other improvements could be made to the script?</p>
