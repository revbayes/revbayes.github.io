# RevBayes Chromosome Evolution Tutorial:
# 
# A BiChroM Analysis
#
# by Will Freyman
#
#
# This is an example of how to test for an association of phenotype and chromosome number evolution
# in RevBayes. Here we set up a binary phenotypic character and estimate separate rates of chromosome
# evolution for each state of the phenotype. The model describes the joint evolution of both the
# phenotypic character and chromosome evolution. This model (BiChroM) was introduced in Zenil‚ÄêFerguson 
# et al. (2017). In RevBayes the BiChroM model can easily be extended to multistate phenotypes and/or 
# hidden states, plus cladogenetic changes could be incorporated into the model.
#
# We'll again use chromosome count data from Ohi-Toma et al. 2006 (Systematic Botany) for the plant 
# genus Aristolochia (commonly called Dutchman's pipe). 
#
# For the phenotype we will examine gynostemium morphology. Aristolochia flowers have an extensively 
# modified perianth that traps and eventually releases pollinators to ensure cross pollination 
# (this is why the flowers resemble pipes and are commonly called Dutchman's pipes). The gynostemium 
# is a reproductive organ found only in Aristolchiaceae and Orchids that consists of fused stamens 
# and pistil that pollinators must interact with during pollination. The subgenus Isotrema has highly
# reduced three-lobed gynostemium. Other members of Aristolochia have gynostemium subdivided into
# 5 to 24 lobes. We'll test for an association of this phenotype with changes in the rates of 
# chromosome evolution. This is probably a silly example, but works well to demonstrate the model.
#
# phenotype state 0 = 3 lobed gynostemium
# phenotype state 1 = 5 t0 24 lobed gynostemium
#
# In this example the phylogeny is assumed known. See the ChromEvol_joint.Rev for an example of jointly 
# estimating chromosome evolution and phylogeny.

# Create some vector for the moves and monitors of this analysis

# Read in the phylogeny. In this example the phylogeny is assumed known.
phylogeny <- readBranchLengthTrees("data/aristolochia.tree")[1]

# We need to limit the maximum number of chromosomes,
# so here we just use the largest chromosome count plus 10.
max_chromo = 26

# Get the chromosome counts from a tab-delimited file.
chromo_data = readCharacterDataDelimited("data/aristolochia_bichrom_counts.tsv", stateLabels=2*(max_chromo + 1), type="NaturalNumbers", delimiter="\t", header=FALSE)

# Chromosome Model
#########################


# We'll use exponential priors to model the rates of polyploidy and 
# dysploidy events along the branches of the phylogeny

# Here we set up two rate parameters for each type of chromosome change --
# one for phenotype state 0 and one for phenotype state 1

# rate of chromosome gains
gamma_0 ~ dnExponential(10.0)
gamma_1 ~ dnExponential(10.0)

# rate of chromosome losses
delta_0 ~ dnExponential(10.0)
delta_1 ~ dnExponential(10.0)

# rate of polyploidization
rho_0 ~ dnExponential(10.0)
rho_1 ~ dnExponential(10.0)

# Add MCMC moves for each of the rates.
moves.append( mvScale(gamma_0, lambda=1, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(delta_0, lambda=1, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(rho_0, lambda=1, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(gamma_1, lambda=1, weight=1) ) 
moves.append( mvScale(delta_1, lambda=1, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(rho_1, lambda=1, weight=1) )

# Now we create the rate matrix for the chromosome evolution model.
# We will set up two rate matrices, one for each phenotype state.

# We will use a simple ChromEvol model that includes
# only the rate of chromosome gain, loss, and polyploidization.
Q_0 := fnChromosomes(max_chromo, gamma_0, delta_0, rho_0)
Q_1 := fnChromosomes(max_chromo, gamma_1, delta_1, rho_1)

# Parameters for demi-polyploidization and rate modifiers could also
# be added at this step for more complex models. For example we
# could have included the rate of demi-polyploidization like this:
# Q := fnChromosomes(max_chromo, gamma, delta, rho, eta)

# Now we create the rates of transitioning between phenotype states:
q_01 ~ dnExponential(10.0)
q_10 ~ dnExponential(10.0)
moves.append( mvScale(q_01, lambda=1, weight=1) )
moves.append( mvScale(q_10, lambda=1, weight=1) )

# And finally we create the transition rate matrix for the joint
# model of phenotypic and chromosome evolution.

# First we will initialize the matrix with all zeros:
s = Q_0[1].size()
for (i in 1:(2 * s)) {
    for (j in 1:(2 * s)) {
        Q[i][j] := 0.0
    }
}

# And now populate the matrix with transition rates:
for (i in 1:(2 * s)) {
    for (j in 1:(2 * s)) {
        if (i <= s) {
            if (j <= s) {
                if (i != j) {
                    # chromosome changes within phenotype state 0
                    Q[i][j] := abs(Q_0[i][j])
                }
            } else {
                if (i == (j - s)) {
                    # transition from phenotype state 0 to 1
                    Q[i][j] := q_01
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (j <= s) { 
                if (i == (j + s)) {
                    # transition from phenotype state 1 to 0
                    Q[i][j] := q_10
                }
            } else {
                if (i != j) {
                    # chromosome changes within phenotype state 1
                    k = i - s
                    l = j - s
                    Q[i][j] := abs(Q_1[k][l])
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Q_b := fnFreeK(Q, rescaled=false)

# Here we assume the frequency of chromosome numbers at the root of the tree
# are equal. Alternatively, you may want to treat the root frequencies
# as a free variable and estimate them from the observed data (we discuss this elsewhere).
root_frequencies := simplex(rep(1, 2 * s))

# Now create the stochastic node for the chromosome evolution continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC).
chromo_ctmc ~ dnPhyloCTMC(Q=Q_b, tree=phylogeny, rootFreq=root_frequencies, type="NaturalNumbers")

# and clamp the observed chromosome counts data.
chromo_ctmc.clamp(chromo_data)

# Finally we wrap our model into a single model object.
mymodel = model(phylogeny)

# MCMC
#########################


# Create the MCMC monitors:
# First, a screen monitor with some useful variables:
monitors.append( mnScreen(printgen=10) )

# The ancestral state monitor for sampling ancestral states:
monitors.append( mnJointConditionalAncestralState(filename="output/BiChroM_anc_states.log", printgen=10, tree=phylogeny, ctmc=chromo_ctmc, type="NaturalNumbers") )

# And another monitor for all the model variables:
monitors.append( mnModel(filename="output/BiChroM_model.log", printgen=10) )

# Now set up the MCMC.
mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, monitors, moves)

# Run the MCMC. Note that for a real analysis you'd want to run many more 
# iterations and check for convergence.
mymcmc.run(200)


#########################
# Summarize the results 
#########################


# Now let's summarize the sampled ancestral chromosome numbers.
# First, read in the ancestral state trace:
anc_state_trace = readAncestralStateTrace("output/BiChroM_anc_states.log")

# Finally, summarize the values from the traces over the phylogeny.
# Here we do a marginal reconstruction of the ancestral states, discarding the first 25% of samples
# as burnin.
ancestralStateTree(phylogeny, anc_state_trace, "output/BiChroM_final.tree", burnin=0.25, reconstruction="marginal")


#########################################################################################################
#
# Open BiChroM_final.tree in FigTree and look at the ancestral state node labels.
# The 3 states with the highest posterior probabilities are given, along with their marginal
# posterior probabilities.
#
# Finally, you could use the RevGadgets R package to generate a PDF plot of the ancestral states
# like in the other examples (see plot_BiChroM.R).
