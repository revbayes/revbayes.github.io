Conventions: File paths are relative to the repository root. 

Preparations
------------
Make sure you have Java (JRE) on your system: if the command 
```
which java
```
{:.bash}

responds with a file path, like /usr/bin/java, then you're fine, otherwise browse to the [java download page](http://java.com/en/download/) and download the JRE. 

  
Now, browse to [netbeans download page](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) and download the C++ or "All" bundled Netbeans distribution. Navigate to the downloaded file in a terminal and run "chmod +x &lt;netbeans-script&gt;" then ./&lt;netbeans-script&gt; to install. Note, the "All" bundle will probably require JDK (Java Development Kit) to be installed on your computer, [download jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

  
By default Netbeans has quite limited memory available and you probably want to increase it to make things run faster: 

  1. Open the configuration file, &lt;your home folder&gt;/netbeans-&lt;version&gt;/etc/netbeans.conf in a text editor. On a MacIntosh, the path is likely to be /Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans\ &lt;version&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/NetBeans/etc/netbeans.conf. 
  2. Prepend the settings to the default_options so that line will look like this: "netbeans_default_options="-J-Xmx2g -J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC &lt;other settings&gt;". 

  


The Netbeans project described here will use the Makefile generated by the CMake script /projects/cmake/regenerate.sh. Before setting up our project it is conventient to have all the files needed in place so let's start with running these commands in a terminal: 

```
cd  <path-to-revbayes>/revbayes/projects/cmake 
./regenerate 
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull 
make -j 4 (4 = the number of processors on your computer) 
```
{:.bash}

Netbeans setup
---------------
  1. In Netbeans, Press CTRL+shift+n to start the new project wizard. Select category C++ and project C++ project with existing sources and move to next step. 

  2. In this step, select the git root directory as source folder, and tick the "custom" mode. 

  3. Select the Makefile to use 

  4. Configure build settings. Alternatively you can set "build command" = "${MAKE} -j 4" and "build result" pointing to the "rb" executable. 

  5. Code assistance can be slow if choosing all files, so narrow it down by ticking "Custom" and append "/src" to the path suggested by Netbeans. 

  6.  That's it, finish the wizard and compile your code by pressing the F11 key. 

  
Here are some handy keyboard shortcuts to start with: 

  * Ctrl+click, navigate to definition 
  * Alt+&#8592;, go back where you where before Ctrl+click 
  * Ctrl+r, refactor code 
  * Alt+shift+f, format code 
  * Ctrl+shift+c, comment/comment out code 

On [Netbeans wiki](http://wiki.netbeans.org/Keyboard_Shortcuts) you can download the full map for keyboard shortcuts. Happy coding!
